> Support for students and colleagues affected by the events in the Middle East.

We are all of us profoundly shaken by the events in Israel and Gaza and the devastating loss of life and suffering.

Our priority continues to be supporting all members of our international community who may be personally affected in any way. Visit the [support during times of humanitarian crisis and global conflict](/students/updates/global-conflict/) page for further information.
