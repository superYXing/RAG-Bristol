> Information and updates on industrial action at the University of Bristol.

The University of Bristol has been in a period of industrial action. There are currently no further dates planned.

## About industrial action

Industrial action can include:

* strikes, where a trade union member does not attend work on a specific date/s
* action short of strike (ASOS), where a member only works contracted hours but does not volunteer to do more.

Not all staff are members of a trade union, and not all trade union members participate in strikes.

The University remains open on strike days and we will seek to mitigate the impact of Industrial Action on teaching and assessment.

If you have a student visa, any cancelled classes or contact points will be recorded as an authorised absence with a note to say that this is due to industrial action.

[Contact our International Student Visa Advisers](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/contacts/) with any questions.

## Industrial action reimbursement fund

Students who experience disruption due to the industrial action are eligible to [claim from the industrial action reimbursement fund](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/industrial-action-support/) for costs incurred, for example, childcare and travel when they arrive for a class that is then cancelled.

## Student complaints

### Formal complaints

Students may raise a complaint with respect to the impact of Industrial Action.

Formal complaints will be considered in accordance with the [Student Complaints Procedure](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/secretary/documents/student-rules-and-regs/Student-Complaints-Procedure.pdf) (PDF, 179 KB).

We understand that the impact of industrial action will vary between students. In reviewing your complaint we will consider whether we have a full picture of the impact of industrial action and what appropriate measures in mitigation were put in place. We will keep you updated on the timeframe in which you should expect to receive the outcome of your complaint.

You can also seek independent support from the [SU's Academic Advice service](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/support/academic-advice).
