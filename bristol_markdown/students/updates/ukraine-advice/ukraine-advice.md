> A summary of support available to those affected by the invasion of Ukraine.

## Support for students who are concerned over family members in Ukraine, Russia or Belarus

You can [request support from our wellbeing services](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/request-support/) or speak to your [personal tutor](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/personal-tutors/) or senior tutor for help and advice.

## Support for students currently unable to travel or return home to Ukraine/Russia/Belarus

The [Home Office has confirmed](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/home-secretary-announces-visa-concessions-for-ukrainians) that Ukrainian students who are on study visas in the UK will have their visas temporarily extended or be able to switch to different visa routes. You can [contact Student Visa Services](mailto:student-visa-advice@bristol.ac.uk) for advice around your immigration status. For any other concerns (e.g. financial issues) please [contact Student Services](mailto:student-services@bristol.ac.uk).

## Disruption to your studies

Please contact your school or tutor in the first instance if your studies are disrupted. Any disruption may have impacts on funding or student visas, please [contact Student Services](mailto:student-services@bristol.ac.uk) for support.

## Support for exchange students in Ukraine, Russia or Belarus

We have a small number of students on placement in Russia, in locations well away from the Ukraine border. Government advice (28 February 2022) recommends against all travel to Russia so we are asking students to return to the UK immediately. Additional costs incurred in travelling will be refunded. The [Global Opportunities team](mailto:go-abroad@bristol.ac.uk) can help with any enquiries or issues.

## Financial support for students affected by the impact on the Russian banking sector

The Student Funding Office can provide a range of support to students, including [Emergency support payments](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/emergency-funds/emergency-support-payments-/) and [hardship funding](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/emergency-funds/financial-assistance-fund/international-and-eu-financial-assistance-fund-/). Remember that you will need a [UK bank account](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/new/new-international/after/open-a-bank-account/) to receive financial support. If you need help opening a bank account please visit the [Global Lounge in Senate House](https://global-lounge.bristol.ac.uk/).  If you do not have a UK bank account, food vouchers can be issued in emergency situations. If you would like to discuss any of the financial support available please contact [student-services@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:student-services@bristol.ac.uk).

## Further student support

Individual student issues can be [sent to Student Services](mailto:student-services@bristol.ac.uk) who will help to find the right support. Bristol SU also has a Ukraine [support page](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/articles/ukraine-support-for-students/) with events, latest updates and advice.

## How you can help
