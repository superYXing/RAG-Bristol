> Our view on UK Supreme Court's ruling, in relation to For Women Scotland (Ltd) versus the Scottish Ministers.

We are aware that the recent ruling by the UK Supreme Court in the case of For Women Scotland Ltd v The Scottish Ministers has left some feeling uncertain and anxious.

Being caring and inclusive are fundamental values of the University of Bristol. This has not changed. We want to assure all members of our community that we remain committed to fostering an inclusive and supportive environment for all, where everyone feels welcome and respected.  We understand some members of the community may be feeling unsettled at this time and might benefit from some wellbeing support.

For students, this can be found at: [Student Wellbeing Services](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/managing-student-life/)   
For staff, this can be accessed through [Staff Wellbeing Resources](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/wellbeing).

We understand there will be a range of different views about the ruling.  We recognise and support everyone’s right to engage in respectful debate and open dialogue across our community in line with our core principles of freedom of speech and academic freedom

We thank you for doing so with empathy.   
   
We are now looking at the practical implications of the [Equality for Human Rights Commission interim guidance](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/media-centre/interim-update-practical-implications-uk-supreme-court-judgment) and will update any relevant policies as appropriate.
