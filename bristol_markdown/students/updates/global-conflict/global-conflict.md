> We are an international university with a deep commitment to social responsibility and democratic values. This includes providing support where people have been affected by humanitarian crisis and conflict across the globe.

The past few years have been very challenging from a global perspective. There have been conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East, Sudan and elsewhere. There have also been disasters such as the Myanmar earthquake and the Air India crash. The impacts of these events are being felt deeply by communities worldwide, including our own at Bristol.

Many people in our University community have connections to, or loved ones living in, areas affected by international violence and crisis. If this includes you, then we are here to help you.

We continue to encourage anyone who is struggling or affected in any way to reach out for support.

## Wellbeing support

## Reporting unacceptable behaviour

We are proud to be a community of communities, home to all nationalities and faiths. This encompasses many different groups with wide-ranging personal experiences and views.

Every member of our community should feel safe and included on our campuses.

Our role as a university is to create a tolerant environment for the exchange of ideas, where people can talk about different views. We must also uphold and protect freedom of speech on campus within the law.

There is no place for any form of racism, discrimination, incitement, bullying, or harassment at the University of Bristol. Any reports of such behaviour will be taken very seriously. 

If you have experienced any form of unacceptable behaviour, we urge you to report it by:

* [making a formal report](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/report-unacceptable-behaviour/how-to-report/#report)
* [reporting anonymously](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/report-unacceptable-behaviour/how-to-report/#anonymous)
* [asking for support](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/report-unacceptable-behaviour/how-to-report/#support).

## How you can help

You may want to provide help to those affected. Donating through established and well-coordinated emergency response appeals is the most effective way to help. Various appeals are available if you would like to donate, such as:

* [The British Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org.uk/get-involved/donate/our-current-appeals)
* [Save the Children](https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/welcome)
