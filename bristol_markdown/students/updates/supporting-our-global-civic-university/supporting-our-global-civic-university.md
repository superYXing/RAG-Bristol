> The University of Bristol is a University of Sanctuary in a City of Sanctuary. We are part of a positive movement to welcome migrants into our community. We promote a culture of inclusion.

There is no place for violence, intimidation, Islamophobia, or any form of racism in Bristol. Every member of our community deserves to feel safe and included.

We have signed [a joint statement](https://news.bristol.gov.uk/press-releases/03748667-d5f7-4404-9f41-967f25d8b50f/everyone-is-welcome-bristol-partners-statement) with Bristol City Council, other universities, colleges, and faith leaders. It reaffirms our determination to stamp out abusive behaviour and intimidation on our streets.

The main message is that:

* we are stronger when we are together
* everyone belongs
* everyone is welcome.

It highlights the values of:

* compassion
* unity
* respect.

These are values that we can all share and aspire to, no matter our background or circumstance.

We are proud of the diversity of our staff and students, and how they help make Bristol a vibrant and diverse city. Bristol has a strong love of community and an independent spirit. This unique identity is one of our city’s greatest strengths. No one should feel unsettled, vulnerable, or unsafe in Bristol, and we are ready to provide support if you need it.

## Staying safe

Security Services has created a [personal Safety webpage](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/securityservices/personalsafety/). This has advice and guidance on staying safe in the city.

Our [Multifaith Chaplaincy](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/multifaith-chaplaincy/) is also available for faith-based or spiritual support. There are locations for quiet prayer available across campus and the city.
