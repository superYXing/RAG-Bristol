## Travel to the UK

### Before you leave

Check:

* your government's restrictions on taking money out of your home country.
* what [items you can bring into the UK](https://www.gov.uk/bringing-goods-into-uk-personal-use).
* your luggage weight against your airline's allowance.
* that your travel insurance is valid. If you do not have travel insurance we recommend that you get some and bring the insurance documents with you.
* that you have brought [these important documents in your hand luggage](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/new/new-international/before/visa-and-important-documents/).

### When to travel

#### **If you are staying in University accommodation**

If you will be living in a University of Bristol residence, aim to arrive when your accommodation opens. We will contact you with information about residence opening dates and times.

#### **If you are staying in private accommodation**

If you have already arranged private accommodation, check with your landlord when you can move in before you book your travel.

## Arriving in the UK

### At the border

Read the current [government advice pages about entering the UK](https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control).

To help you through passport control and customs when you arrive at the UK border, read the [UK Border Force guide to faster travel through the UK border](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coming-to-the-uk/faster-travel-through-the-uk-border).

## Travel to Bristol from within the UK

You will need to arrange your own transport between the airport and the city of Bristol. Take a look at the transport options on this page to help plan your journey.

### Bus/coach to Bristol

Buses and coaches are generally the cheapest means of travel in the UK. The most popular companies amongst our students are National Express, Megabus, Flixbus, and A1 Bristol Airport Flyer.

National Express offers a [20% discount on airport coach travel](https://www.nationalexpress.com/en/offers/partners/bristol-uni-transfers?utm_source=bristol-uni-transfers&utm_medium=businessdevelopment&vouchercode=BRISTOLUNIAT20).

* [National Express](https://www.nationalexpress.com/en/offers/partners/bristol-uni-transfers?utm_source=bristol-uni-transfers%20%20&utm_medium=businessdevelopment&vouchercode=BRISTOLUNIAT20) and [Flixbus](https://www.flixbus.co.uk/) coaches arrive at Bristol Bus and Coach Station.
* [Megabus](https://uk.megabus.com/) coaches stop at Bond Street, Bristol.
* If you are travelling from Bristol Airport get the [A1 Bristol Airport Flyer](https://flyer.bristolairport.co.uk/) bus from outside the airport terminal. You can get off at Bristol Bus and Coach Station or Bristol Temple Meads. You can book tickets in advance or buy them onboard.

Make sure you check restrictions on luggage. If you have more than one large suitcase, you might need to pay a fee or buy additional tickets for each piece of large luggage.

### Train to Bristol

Trains are popular choices of transport in the UK. They are usually more expensive than buses, but students tend to find them more comfortable, scenic, faster, and less likely to provoke travel sickness.

There are railway stations near most airports, which you can use to travel to Bristol’s main station, called Bristol Temple Meads. You may need to change trains multiple times so bear this in mind when choosing your ticket.

You can [purchase train tickets online](https://www.thetrainline.com/), or at the station on the day. It can be cheaper to book your tickets for inter-city travel (moving between cities and regions) before your journey.

### Taxi to Bristol

Some private taxi companies offer an airport transport service or other long-distance transfers. If you are travelling with others, you can split the fare and pre-book stops at different addresses.

Costs vary, so compare prices and read reviews before booking.

We have used the following services in the past. They offer a small discount for University of Bristol students. Let them know you are a Bristol student if you decide to get a quote for their services:

* [Go Executive Travel](https://www.goexectravel.co.uk/services/student-transfers/)
* [Haywards Travel](mailto:bookings@haywardstravel.com)
* [Pro Line Taxi](https://prolinetaxi.com/airport-transfers-for-university-of-bristol-students/)

## Travel within Bristol to your accommodation

### Public transport

You can get to your accommodation by public transport, which includes buses, trains or taxis (try a [local journey planner](https://journeyplanner.travelwest.info/directions)).

### Train

Some of Bristol’s residential train stations include:

* Clifton Down

### Taxi

It is very common to order local taxis through apps like [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/en-gb/cities/bristol/), [Ola](https://www.olacabs.com/), [Uber](https://www.uber.com/global/en/cities/bristol/) and [Zoom cars](https://www.zoomcars.org/). Not all apps offer pre-booking services, but [Zoom cars](https://www.zoomcars.org/) and [Uber](https://www.uber.com/global/en/r/cities/bristol-eng-gb/) do.

You can also get a taxi without pre-booking from the taxi ranks. Find taxi ranks: [Taxi ranks | Open Data Bristol](https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/datasets/taxi-ranks/explore "https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/datasets/taxi-ranks/explore")

### Walking

Alternatively, if you are not carrying much luggage and you live nearby one of the main stations, then you might find it easiest to walk to your accommodation. Find walking directions on Google Maps:
