> Once you’ve accepted your offer, there are some things you need to do before you arrive.

## Confirm your registration details

You need to confirm your registration details before you arrive so you can complete your registration when you get here.

We'll send you an email inviting you to register. You won’t be able to confirm your details until you receive it.

Most students will get this email on 27 August 2025.

## Complete your student document check

To complete registration, some students need to present their documents to prove they can study in the UK.

We’ll tell you if this applies to you. Your online student record will also show if you need to complete a document check.
