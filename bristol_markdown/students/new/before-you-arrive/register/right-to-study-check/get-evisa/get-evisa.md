> As part of your student document check (right to study), you will need an eVisa and share code to prove you can study in the UK (unless you are a short-term visiting or exchange student).

### 1. Create a UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) account

You need a UKVI account to get your eVisa and share code.

[Get a UKVI account at gov.uk.](https://www.gov.uk/get-access-evisa)

### 2. Check your eVisa details

Before you travel, make sure [your eVisa details are correct](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-sure-your-evisa-is-correct-before-you-travel).

Check these details are correct on your eVisa and passport:

* name
* nationality
* date of birth
* sex
* passport
* Visa expiry date (this will depend on the length of your course).

See [course dates and visa expiry dates](/directory/visas/student-visa/error/).

### 3. Connect your passport to your eVisa

Link the passport you will use to travel to your eVisa. You must do this **before** travelling.

### 4. Get a share code

You need a share code to study here, and you may need to show your share code when you travel. It proves your immigration status and right to study in the UK.

Select 'another reason' as your reason for getting a share code. Your code must start with 'S' for ‘study’.

[Get your share code.](https://www.gov.uk/view-prove-immigration-status)

Your share code is valid for 90 days.

### 5. Email your share code to the Student Visas team

Email [student-visas@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:student-visas@bristol.ac.uk) with your:

* ‘S’ share code
* date of birth
* University of Bristol application or student number (this will be on your course offer letter).

### 6. Attend your student document check (right to study)
