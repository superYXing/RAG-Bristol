> To complete registration, some students need to present their documents to the University to prove they can study in the UK.

As part of your registration, you will be told whether you need to present your documents to finalise your registration. Your online student record will also say if you need to complete a document check.

If you are required to, but do not complete this step, you will not be able to register for your course of study.

We have to check that the information you provide meets UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) requirements and ensure that you have the right to study in the UK.

This check is based on the nationality listed in your application and student record. It is not based on your fee status, so you may be required to attend a check even if you are a UK resident and pay home fees.

## Students who must attend a student document check

You must have your documents checked if you:

* are a new student or enrolling on a new course and your nationality is subject to immigration control
* are returning to the University after a suspension and your nationality is subject to immigration control
* are a returning student and we need information from you about your visa
* have a new Student visa for any other reason
* do not have a nationality listed on your student record.

## How to complete your student document check

Student document checks are held at [Senate House](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Senate+House+Study+Centre/@51.4587949,-2.6040569,19.62z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x9627166d401816ca!8m2!3d51.4589784!4d-2.6034359) on the upper ground floor, by the Student Services' desks.

You must [book an appointment](https://outlook.office.com/book/bk_RTSandBRP@bristol.ac.uk/?ismsaljsauthenabled) before attending.

### Before your appointment

* Confirm your [registration details](https://www.bris.ac.uk/studentinfo/new/)
* Get an [eVisa and share code](/students/new/before-you-arrive/register/right-to-study-check/get-evisa/). To get this, you will need a [UKVI account](https://www.gov.uk/get-access-evisa). Select 'another reason' as your reason for getting a share code. Your code must start with 'S'.

[If you are a short-term visiting or exchange student](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/new/before-you-arrive/register/right-to-study-check/#visitor), you do not need to bring a share code, UKVI account or eVisa to your appointment.

### If you are a visitor

You still need to come to an in-person check, even if you:

* travelled through eGates
* have an electronic travel authorisation (ETA)
* do not have a physical visa.

Bring your flight tickets and passport.

### What to bring

You must bring to your appointment:

* your passport
* your share code.

You should bring these documents if you have them:

* flight details of when you arrived in the UK on a Student visa. For example, a flight ticket or boarding pass.
* an email from UKVI confirming your Student visa application.
* evidence of your new visa application. For example, a visa application form or a visa application receipt.
* an email from UKVI confirming your visa application outcome/decision.

Your documents must be original. We do not accept scans or photocopies.

We store copies of your documents as part of our sponsor duties.

## Late registration

Check the latest registration date for:

* [new students](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/new/before-you-arrive/register/#late.:~:text=Latest%20dates%20for%20new%20students%20to%20complete%20registration%3A)

You must arrive, and complete your registration and student document check (right to study), by the latest registration date.

If you do not do this, your student record and any relevant visa sponsorship will be withdrawn.

We do not offer further extensions for any reason. If you will not arrive before the latest registration date, do not travel.
