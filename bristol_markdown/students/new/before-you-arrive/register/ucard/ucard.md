> Your UCard is your personal University card. You need a UCard to access campus facilities.

## Before collecting your UCard

At least 48 hours before collecting your UCard you must:

* [Confirm your registration details](https://bristol.ac.uk/studentinfo/new/)
* [Upload your photo](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cardservices/photo-upload-instructions/).

## How to collect your UCard

Collect your UCard from the Card Services office at [Royal Fort Lodge, BS8 1UH](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Royal+Fort+Lodge,+Bristol+BS8+1UH/@51.458334,-2.6058667,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x48718ddbc3911717:0x99cc0679434f1fa4!8m2!3d51.4583307!4d-2.6032918!16s%2Fg%2F1tkb4kjq?entry=ttu) on Tyndall Avenue (opposite Senate House).

## Activate your UCard

Once you have collected your UCard, you will need to swipe it on a wall-mounted card reader (or library entrance card reader). Hold it there for 10 to 15 seconds to activate it and complete registration.

It may take up to 2 hours before our systems update and you are fully registered.

## UCard data use

We store data from your UCard which shows when you use your UCard to enter a University building.

We use this data to ensure support and services are available. This use of your data is part of [section 10 of the Student Agreement](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/secretary/student-rules-regs/).
