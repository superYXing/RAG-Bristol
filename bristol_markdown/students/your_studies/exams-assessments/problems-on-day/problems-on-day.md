> What to do if you have a problem during your exam or assessment and who to contact for help.

## Online exam problems

If you are doing an online exam and experience any problems during the exam, telephone Student Services for help: [+44 (0)117 428 3000](tel:+441174283000 "tel:01174283000").

If the upload time has passed, [contact your school](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/help/#school) for help as this is considered a non-submission.

If you are doing a timed assessment and experience any problems, [contact your school](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/help/#school).

Make sure you are familiar with the [end time and deadline for uploading your finished exam](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/your-studies/teaching-and-learning/assessments/).

## Exam paper errors

If you think there is an error on the exam paper:

1. Raise your hand to let an invigilator know.
2. Write what the exam question says, and what you think the question should say, in the margins of your answer book.
3. Answer the question as best as you can.

The invigilator will write an ‘incident report’. We will decide if any adjustments should be made when we mark your paper.

## Missing or incorrect papers

You should raise your hand to let an invigilator know, if you think:

* part of your exam is missing, such as a paper or separate formula sheet
* the papers you have been given are incorrect.

## Disturbances

If there is disruption in the exam hall, such as the need to leave the building, the invigilator will tell you what to do.

No extra time is given, but the invigilator will write an incident report to tell the exam board about the disruption. They will investigate and decide what (if any) adjustments should be made.

## Leaving the exam hall

When you leave the exam hall, some students may still be writing. You must leave quietly and not disturb them.
