## How to view your exam timetable

[View your exam timetable](https://exam-timetables.sls.bris.ac.uk/)

Once your timetable is visible, check that you can see all of the exams for the units you are enrolled on. If there are errors or anything is missing, [contact your school office](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/help/#school) immediately.

## What's on your exam timetable

Your timetable includes exams that start and end on the same day during [university assessment periods](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/dates/#academic). You can see the date, time, and venue of your exam(s).

Most on campus exams start at 9:15 am or 2:15 pm.

Select the exam venue in your timetable to get a Google map showing where the venue is.

If your exam has seat numbers, these will be confirmed a few days before the assessment period starts.

Your timetable will indicate if you have alternative exam arrangements. Find out more about what will be [displayed and how additional arrangements will be confirmed](/students/support/disability-support/study-support/guide-to-aeas/).

### Online exams

Online exams that are run during university assessment periods are included on your timetable.

Most online exams start at 9:45 am.

End times of online exams will be available in Blackboard a few days after your timetable is released.

### Other assessments

Details of other assessments, including coursework, practical assessments, and timed assessments of four days or more, will be available [in your portal](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/assessment-marks). Select 'View assessment details'.

You will be emailed when they are ready to view.

## Exam or assessment clashes

You may have two or more different types of assessments scheduled at the same time.

For example, a single-day assessment may run alongside a four-day or longer open book timed assessment. This means you may sit an exam during a period where you are also working on an assessment with a longer time frame. This is not considered a clash.

## Questions

If you have any questions, [contact your school office](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/help/#school).
