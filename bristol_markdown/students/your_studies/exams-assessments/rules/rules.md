## Before your exam

Find out what to do if you are ill and about to [miss an exam or assessment](/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/missed-exam-assessment/).

Check [what you need to bring with you on the day](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/your-studies/exams-assessments/what-to-take "What to take into an exam"), and what you should leave at home.

## Arriving at your exam

* You should arrive at the venue at least 30 minutes before the start of your exam and enter the exam venue when instructed.
* Leave bags, coats and any electronic devices (including mobile phones and smart watches) in the designated area before finding your seat.
* If you have a seat number on your timetable, you **must sit at your allocated desk**. Otherwise, you could be marked as absent from the exam.

### Late arrivals

* If you arrive more than 30 minutes after the start of the exam, you will not be allowed into the hall and will be directed to speak to your School/Department.
* If you arrive late, enter the hall quietly and alert an invigilator.
* No additional time will be allowed for students arriving late.

## During your exam

* Find out what happens if you experience a disturbance, exam paper error, or [problem during your exam](/students/your-studies/exams-assessments/problems-on-day/).
* If you have any questions during an exam, raise your hand and wait for an invigilator to help you.
* You must stay **silent at all times in the exam hall** unless you are quietly talking to an invigilator.
* If you open your exam booklet, read the exam questions, or start writing before you are told to do so by the invigilator, you will be reported for cheating.
* At the end of the exam, you must stop writing when the invigilator tells you to do so. If you continue to write, this will be considered cheating.
* When you finish your exam, remain seated and silent until the invigilator permits you to leave.

## Leaving your exam

* You are not allowed to leave the exam hall during the first 30 minutes and last 15 minutes of an exam.
* You are not allowed to leave the room and return at other times during the exam unless accompanied by an invigilator. This includes toilet breaks. If you leave the room unaccompanied, you will not be allowed to return.

## Cheating

Suspected cheating incidents will be reported to your school/department and dealt with under the [University disciplinary regulations](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/assessment/regulations-and-code-of-practice-for-taught-programmes/penalties/).

If you are suspected of cheating:

* you will be handed a 'Notice of Suspected Malpractice' during the exam and must explain to the invigilator at the end of the exam
* your exam answer book and any unauthorised material will be removed
* you will be given a new answer book so that you may finish the exam.

Read the [guidance on academic integrity](/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/).
