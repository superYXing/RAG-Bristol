Some of our courses which lead to professional or vocational qualifications (e.g. in health sciences, social work, PGCE) and the International Foundation Programme run to slightly different schedules.

### Welcome week (15 to 19 September 2025)

All taught students are expected to be on campus during welcome week. The week is full of events to help you settle in. Some are mandatory, others are about starting your time with us in the best way.

### Teaching block 1

## Teaching weeks: 22 September to 12 December 2025

You will be expected to follow the regular teaching timetable for your programme. Some assessment deadlines may also fall during these weeks. Your school will keep you informed.

## Consolidation week: 27 to 31 October 2025

Halfway through both terms, taught students on programmes that follow the standard structure of the year will have the same consolidation week. Most schools suspend their normal teaching timetable in this week, or may offer alternative activites.

This is an opportunity to take stock of your learning to date, make progress on assessment work and catch your breath midway through term.

If you are taking a unit which runs in just the first half of teaching block 1, you may have an exam this week. Your school will let you know. All regular university services are open as usual.

## Assessment preparation week: 8 to 12 December 2025

This week will provide you with the time to write up coursework or do revision. Any timetabled classes should focus on support with revision or guidance on completing your work rather than teaching new material.

The number and type of activities planned in this week will depend on your programme. Some coursework deadlines and timed assessments may fall in this week.

## Assessment week: 15 to 19 December 2025

The teaching block 1 assessment period will be one week only. If you have a teaching block 1 exam, it will take place this week, and some coursework deadlines and timed assessments may also be scheduled in this week.

All assessment for teaching block 1 will be completed before the winter vacation. This means you can have a proper break between teaching blocks and take the opportunity to rest, work, engage in social activity, and prepare for the new term.

## Winter vacation: 22 December 2025 to 9 January 2026

There are no taught classes or assessments in this period.

Most university services remain open, except during our closure period (24 December to 2 January inclusive).

The Global Lounge will have a [range of activities](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/campus/events/calendar/#start_date=2024-12-14;end_date=2025-01-05) for students staying in Bristol through the holiday closure.

If you have requested a coursework extension for a teaching block 1 assessment, in most cases the extended deadline will fall within the first week of the vacation, before the university closure period.

### Teaching block 2

### Preparation week: 12 to 16 January 2026

The first week back in January will be an opportunity to prepare for your learning in teaching block 2 and may include:

* reading
* collaborating with other students
* revising your skills
* getting to know Bristol better.

Some schools may run activities related to your course, but the regular teaching timetable will not run in this week. All our services will operate in Bristol this week.

There will be a [programme of events on campus](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/campus/events/calendar/#start_date=2025-01-06;end_date=2025-01-10), a new year’s opportunity to engage with sports and exercise, library and study skills, and the [careers service](https://mycareer.bristol.ac.uk/user/events.html?execution=e2s1). Try something new, top up your skills profile or prepare for the future.

The [Global Lounge](https://global-lounge.bristol.ac.uk/events/) will be continuing its vacation programme with opportunities to get to know Bristol better and meet our students from all over the world.

### Teaching weeks: 19 January to 1 May 2026

In these weeks you will be expected to follow the regular teaching timetable for your programme. As in teaching block 1, some coursework deadlines and timed assessments may fall in these weeks.

### Consolidation week: 23 to 27 February 2026

This will follow the pattern of the teaching block 1 consolidation week.

### Spring vacation: 23 March to 10 April 2026

Many services will remain open through most of the spring vacation, though the university has a closure period from 18 to 22 April inclusive when most services will not be available.

### Assessment preparation week: 27 April to 1 May 2026

This week has the same purpose as the teaching block 1 assessment preparation week.

For 2024/25, the teaching block 2 assessment preparation week happens before the spring vacation which is from 7 to 25 April 2025. This won’t always be the way it works out because the dates of the spring vacation depend on when Easter falls each year.

### Assessments: 5 to 22 May 2026

If your course includes exams, they will be scheduled in these weeks. Some coursework assessment deadlines and timed assessments may also be scheduled in these weeks.

The last week of summer term is 19 to 23 May 2025. There will be no teaching, but students should be available during this week.

Academic misconduct panels may take place and, in exceptional circumstances, scheduled assessments could take place in this week.

### Summer vacation (undergraduate students): starts 1 June 2026

No teaching for undergraduate students will take place during the summer weeks but supervision will continue for taught postgraduate students. Teaching may take place for students on short courses, pre-sessional programmes and other continued professional development.

### Reassessment period: 21 to 31 July 2026

The reassessment period will be for two weeks during the summer. Resit or deferred exams take place in these weeks. The standard deadline for coursework reassessment will be 21 July 2026.

### Dissertation final assessment submission deadline (postgraduate taught students): 4 September 2026

The dissertation submission deadline will always be at the end of the 51st week after the start of Welcome week.
