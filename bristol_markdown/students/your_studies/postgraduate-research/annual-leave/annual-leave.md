> Information about the types of leave and absence available to postgraduate research students.

## On this page:

* [Types of leave and absence](#types)
* [If you are employed by the University or an external body](#employed)
* [How to request leave or an absence](#request)
* [Absence entitlements and funding](#absence)
* [If you are a Student visa holder](#visa)
* [Support and wellbeing](#support)
* [Policies and documents](#policies)

There are different types of leave and absence, depending on your situation. There may also be specific things to think about, because of funding status and visa conditions.

There are two ways you can record leave or absence:

* [request a suspension of studies](#suspension)
* [submit a short-term absence form.](#short-term)

## Types of leave and absence

This table provides an overview of available types of leave. There is more information in our [guidance for managing absence for PGR students (Office document, 89kB)](/media-library/sites/currentstudents/documents/managing-pgr-absence-guidance.docx).

For more detail on specific terms and duration of each type of leave, see [the PGR student leave entitlements section](/academic-quality/pg/code-of-practice/rights-responsibilities/leave/) of the PGR Code.

| Leave or absence | Eligibility / duration |
| --- | --- |
| Annual leave | Annual leave is recorded as short-term absence.  25 days of annual leave per year (pro-rata for part-time students). [UK bank holidays and University closure days](/university/dates/) are on top of this allowance.  You should inform your main supervisor of your plans and avoid taking more than 4 weeks at a time.  We expect PGR students to plan annual leave so it does not impact their studies.  Student visa holders can request [additional annual leave](#additional) between thesis submission and viva (oral examination). |
| Medical leave | Short periods of medical leave, such as a cold, are recorded as short-term absences. This will not change the end date of your studies.  For longer periods of medical leave, you should consider requesting a suspension of studies.  Medical leave could be for:     + sick leave (including both physical and mental health) + pregnancy-related illness + antenatal appointments + fertility treatment + disability-related illness or appointments (including chronic illness) + gender reassignment.     PGR students must let their supervisors know when they need medical leave.  PGR students can self-certify for periods of up to 7 days (including weekends and holidays). Medical evidence will be required when requesting a suspension, and may be requested for short-term absences over 7 days. |
| Family leave | For periods of family leave you should request a suspension of studies.  Family leave can include:   * maternity leave * partner’s or paternity leave (for partners following the birth of a child) * adoption leave * neonatal care leave * death during the period of maternity/adoption * parental leave. |
| Additional leave | Additional leave covers a range of different leave types. These all have different durations. Some would normally be considered suspensions of studies and others short-term absences. See [the PGR Code](/academic-quality/pg/code-of-practice/rights-responsibilities/leave/) for further details. This type of leave could include:   * baby loss (after the 24th week of pregnancy). * carer’s leave * delays in putting reasonable adjustments in place for a disabled student * delays in putting mitigations in place (Health & Safety-related) * exceptional leave * short-term leave to support bereavement * pregnancy loss (before 24 weeks) * an emergency domestic situation (e.g., fire or burglary) * an emergency involving a dependant (e.g., serious illness or injury) * phased return from leave. |

Other reasons for suspension, which are not covered by specific entitlements in the PGR code, include:

* internship or placement (where the placement is not an integral part of the programme)
* programme transfer
* financial difficulties
* tuition fee debt to the University
* bereavement
* public duties / mandatory military service.

## If you are employed by the University or an external body

Your terms and conditions for absences and leave as a member of staff could be different from student allowances. Contact your relevant HR department for more information.

If you are employed by the University (including on a temporary basis) and your absence affects contracted working arrangements, you must log your absence in myERP, or any other staff systems, in addition to completing a short-term absence form or suspension request.

## How to request leave or an absence

### Requesting a suspension of studies

If you want to suspend your studies, you should speak to your supervisor. You can discuss the appropriate time off, and any implications that you need to consider.

You should follow the University's policies before taking any absence:

* [Regulations and Code of Practice for Research Degrees (PGR Code)](/academic-quality/pg/code-of-practice/)
* [guidance for managing absence for PGR students (Office document, 89kB)](/media-library/sites/currentstudents/documents/managing-pgr-absence-guidance.docx)
* [how to suspend your studies](/students/support/academic-advice/suspend-your-studies/).

### Recording a short-term absence

All short periods of leave including medical leave and annual leave must be recorded. When you record a short-term absence, it is not a formal suspension of studies, and it cannot be taken as ‘approval’ by the University for the absence.

This means attendance requirements still apply, including those for Student visa holders.

You must still inform your supervisor.

#### Submit a short-term absence form

Short-term absences can be recorded:

* in advance (for annual leave and other planned absences)  
  or
* in arrears (for illness or emergencies) up to 30 days after the start date of the absence.

[Open the short-term absence page](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/student-absences)

From this page you can view a list of your absence records, including any suspensions of studies. Use the button at the bottom to ‘Record a new absence’. You can also:

* edit future short-term leave if your plans change
* update past short-term leave if necessary up to 30 days after the start date.

If you need to make changes after this 30-day period, [contact your School or Faculty office](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/faculties/).

Part time students can record their annual leave in hours, rather than study days.

When you complete the form, if your leave covers two years (for example 20 December to 10 January), enter this as two separate records (one for each year).

#### Supporting documentation

You may be asked to provide evidence to support the reasons for an absence. Any evidence provided will not be kept by the University as part of an absence record. If you want to keep a copy, we recommended you store this securely.

#### Data privacy

When you record an absence, the details you provide (such as dates and type of leave) will be stored securely in the University’s student records system (SITS).

Your data will be kept in line with the University’s records retention policy and deleted when no longer required.

Absence information is only shared in limited circumstances, for example with:

* your supervisor and relevant administrative staff for monitoring and support
* UK Visas and Immigration auditors or research funders if required for compliance.

If an extension to funding is agreed due to absence, we may need to let your funders know the high-level reason for absence. We will not share any health or personal-related details externally.

For more information on how we handle your personal data, see our [privacy notices](/secretary/data-protection/privacy-notices/).

## Absence entitlements and funding

Absences are not automatically funded. As a registered student, you are not eligible for statutory pay as you are not an employee of the university.

If you are a funded student, you should check the regulations and stipend entitlements set by your funding provider. Full details are available in the [policy on absence payments for PGR students (Office document, 67kB)](/media-library/sites/students/documents/absence-payments-postgraduate-research-students.docx).

### UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Research Council-funded

If you are a UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) funded PGR student, you can take annual leave, family leave, medical leave or extra leave.

If you receive funding from a [UKRI Research Council](https://www.ukri.org/councils/), the Policy on absence payments for PGR students has more information.

If you are a visa-holding student, your visa may set out specific requirements. These may differ from the Research Council through which you get your funding. You will always need to meet your national and visa requirements.

### University of Bristol-funded

If you are a student funded by the University of Bristol, the Policy on absence payments for PGR students has more information.

We recommend you read these terms early in your studies. This way you will be aware of your entitlements and the processes involved in applying for leave. Your school is the main contact for enquiries about leave entitlements and processes.

### Externally funded (via University of Bristol)

You may receive funding from external institution on whose behalf the University pays your stipend. Your entitlements will depend on the funder's terms and conditions or the contract that underpins your funding.

We recommend you contact your school/doctoral training centre who can talk to you about the exact nature of your funding and the terms of your award. We will administer any funded leave in line with the funder or contract terms.

### Self-funded

If you are self-funded you are eligible for leave, but will receive no funding during a period of absence. Refer to [the PGR Code](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/pg/pgrcode/) for details.

### Sponsored students

If you are [a sponsored student](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/tuition-fees/payment/) (paid your stipend direct), contact your sponsorship provider to understand their terms.

These conditions may be different from [the terms of the PGR Code](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/pg/pgrcode/). You will always need to follow your sponsor’s regulations. These should be in your sponsorship contract. If you are unsure about who to contact for information, contact your school PGR administrator.

## If you are a Student visa holder

If you hold a Student visa:

* we will continue to monitor your attendance during any period of short term absence (non suspended).
* suspension of your studies before or after a period of leave may mean [Student Visas](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/) need to report your absence to the Home Office in line with Student Visa Regulations.
* if you want to take absence or leave that’s longer than two weeks, contact [the Student Visas team](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/contacts/) as soon as possible to understand the implications.

### Additional annual leave for Student visa holders

If you are a Student visa holder, you can request additional annual leave in your final year, between thesis submission and viva (oral examination). See sections 6.8 to 6.10 of [the PGR Code](/academic-quality/pg/code-of-practice/) for more details.

To request additional annual leave:

1. Speak to your School PGR Director (or nominated academic).
2. If approved, record your additional annual leave as [a short-term absence](bristol.ac.uk/student-absences).

If your additional annual leave is approved, you can work full-time hours during this period. Term time [working restrictions](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/after-study/) do not apply.

If your request for additional annual leave is approved, you must email [student-visas@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:student-visas@bristol.ac.uk) to let them know:

* the name of the academic who approved your request
* the date of your viva
* any information you think is relevant.

## Support and wellbeing

Talk to your supervisor so they know about your situation. Your PGR administration team or School PGR Director can also help you consider [any academic support](/students/support/academic-advice/) that may be suitable.

See our [student support services](/students/support/) for support options. You can also [book a wellbeing appointment](/students/support/managing-student-life/book-an-appointment/) if you need to speak to someone.
