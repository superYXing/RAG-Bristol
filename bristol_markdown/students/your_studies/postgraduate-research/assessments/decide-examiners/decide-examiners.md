> Discuss potential examiners with your supervisors a few months before you submit your dissertation (thesis).

You should discuss potential examiners with your supervisors at least 4 months before your dissertation (thesis) submission date.

Once your main supervisor has decided on the examiners, they must submit their names by completing the [Appointment of Research Degree Examiners form (Office document, 81kB)](/media-library/sites/academic-quality/documents/pgr-docs/Appointment-of-Research-Degree-Examiners-form (2).docx)

The examiners will be formally appointed when your dissertation is sent to them by us (the University).

You must not send your dissertation directly to your examiners.

The examiners will arrange a time for the viva (oral exam).
