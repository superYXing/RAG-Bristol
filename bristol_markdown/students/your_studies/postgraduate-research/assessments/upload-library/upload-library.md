> Guidance on submitting your final dissertation to the library for public access, completing the depositor declaration and how to defer public access.

## When to upload your thesis

If you **have no remaining minor errors**, you have 28 days from when you get your award notice to upload the final version of your dissertation.

If you **have remaining minor errors** when you get your award notice, you have 28 days from receiving confirmation that you have satisfactorily corrected those errors to upload the final version of your dissertation.

## What you must upload

1. A PDF version of your final dissertation (or published work and commentary) [through Pure](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/pure "Pure system"). This includes all the corrections required by the examiners. You must not include any:

* + additional text that has not been approved by your examiners
  + personal information, such as email addresses or phone numbers.

2. Depositor declaration (which is completed as part of the upload to Pure).

Follow [the deposit instructions](/staff/researchers/etheses/adding-your-thesis-to-pure/) when uploading to Pure. Your dissertation (or published work and commentary) will then appear in the [University of Bristol Research Portal.](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/) This will be unless you have a [deferral in place](#defer).

If you do not upload your dissertation, you will not receive your degree certificate.

## Request to defer

You can ask to [defer public access](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/your-studies/postgraduate-research/assessments/delay-public-access) to your dissertation. However, you still have to upload it to the library even if you have an approved deferral.
