> What to prepare and expect from your viva (oral exam).

You will need to [submit two electronic copies](/students/your-studies/postgraduate-research/assessments/submit-dissertation/) of your dissertation (thesis).

When they have been appointed, your examiners will arrange a time for your viva (oral exam).

Your internal examiner (or independent chair, if you only have external examiners) will give you at least 10 calendar days of notice.

## Location

The viva can be held in person, partly online or fully online, as agreed between the examiners and you.

## Observer

If someone wishes to attend your viva to observe, this must be requested on the Appointment of Research Degree Examiners (ARDE) form.

If a person wishes to attend the viva after the ARDE form has already been approved, you must submit the [Observers at a viva request form (Office document, 51kB)](/media-library/sites/academic-quality/documents/pgr-docs/Request-for-observers-at-a-viva-form.docx).

If they are given permission to attend, the observer cannot take part in the viva.

## Prepare for the day

* Your supervisors will ask you sample questions.
* Borrow viva cards from Bristol Doctoral College by either emailing [uob-pgr-Hub@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:uob-pgr-Hub@bristol.ac.uk) or visiting their office in Senate House, PGR Hub.
* Practice justifying your research decisions by getting another person to ask you questions.

## Exceptional circumstances

If you have an exceptional circumstance that you believe may impact your performance at the viva, you should discuss this with your supervisors.

## Disability

If you have a disability, discuss [alternative exam arrangements](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/pg/pgr-exam-accommodations/) with your main supervisor. Your main supervisor can request alternative exam arrangements using the [Appointment of Research Degree Examiners form (Office document, 81kB)](/media-library/sites/academic-quality/documents/pgr-docs/Appointment-of-Research-Degree-Examiners-form (2).docx).

For some alternative exam arrangements, it is recommended that a Study Support Plan from [Disability Services](/students/support/disability-support/) is in place.

If alternative exam arrangements are required, the School PGR Director will inform your internal examiner and/or the independent chair.

### If you are ill

If you are ill (or have a personal emergency) on the day of your viva, you should contact your internal examiner (or independent chair if you only have external examiners) to rearrange the date. It is better to rearrange the viva for when you are at your best.

## After the viva: examiners report

Your examiners will complete reports to assist them prepare for the viva.

After the viva, they will also complete a joint final report for [the exam board](/academic-quality/pg/code-of-practice/assessment/exam-board/).

The reports will be shared with you and your supervisors after the exam board has considered them.

### Guidance on corrections

If your examiners recommend minor errors, errors of substance or a resubmission, they will provide you with [feedback after the viva](/students/your-studies/postgraduate-research/assessments/outcome-corrections/) so that you can start making the changes.

The exam board may need examiners to change their feedback or may reach a different decision on the outcome.
