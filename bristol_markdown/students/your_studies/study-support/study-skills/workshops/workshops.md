> Improve your study skills with our in-person and online workshops.

Study skills workshops are small group sessions, focusing on:

* building your confidence in applying academic skills.

The topics change each month. However, you will always see:

* exams and revision workshops appearing a few months before assessments
* dissertation writing workshop in the spring term
* Master’s dissertation workshop in the summer
