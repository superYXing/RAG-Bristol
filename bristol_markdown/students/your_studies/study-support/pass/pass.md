> Peer assisted study sessions (PASS) are student led study sessions where you can ask questions about course material and student life.

The study sessions give you the opportunity to focus on the subject areas you want to work on. They are a friendly and informal safe place to ask questions and improve your confidence in your studies. PASS Leaders are trained later years students who will share their experiences with you.

PASS is now available in most courses in first year. There is no need to sign up.

PASS will not be available in the following subjects for 2025/26:

* BSc Anatomy
* School of Computer Science
* School of Economics
* School of Engineering Mathematics and Technology
* Law School
* School of Mathematics

These subjects may have alternative student-led study sessions.

## Benefits of PASS

Attending the sessions will allow you to:

* chat casually about your course
* have a safe place to ask questions
* gain a deeper understanding of the course material
* make new friends on your course
* get practical advice and improve your study skills,
* build confidence in your subject area and gain a clearer view of course expectations
* meet students from later years on your course and learn from their experiences.

A recent University of Bristol study found full attendance at PASS was associated with grade increases of up to 10.4%.

## Peer mentors

For non-academic support, we also run a [peer mentoring programme](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/peer-mentoring/) for first year undergraduates.

Students in their first term can receive 1 to 1 contact with a current, later years student.

Your mentor will offer advice and recommendations for university life, based on their own experiences.
