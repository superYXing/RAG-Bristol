## What optional units are

Some programmes include optional units in addition to your core, mandatory units.

* **Mandatory units:** you must complete these. Your school will automatically register you for them.
* **Optional units:** you choose these to explore interests or specialise in a topic.

There are 3 types of optional unit:

* **optional units:** linked to your programme.
* **open units:** outside of your subject area. These are available on many undergraduate programmes. [View all open units](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/AllOpenUnits.jsa?ayrCode=24%2F25&selectedCatalogue=UNIT).
* **faculty-wide units:** available in some faculties. Your faculty will let you know if these are an option.

Any optional units available to you will be listed in your programme structure in the [unit and programme catalogue](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/Welcome.jsa), and on your unit selection form.

## Study Abroad students

Study Abroad students follow a different process and do not have optional or mandatory units.

If you're on the **General pathway programme**, the Centre for Study Abroad Inbound Team will contact you about your unit choices. You can also email them at [cfsa-inbound@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:cfsa-inbound@bristol.ac.uk).

If you're on the **Subject pathway programme**, your University of Bristol host school will contact you directly.

## Before submitting your choices

Use the [unit and programme catalogue](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/Welcome.jsa) to check:

* whether your programme allows you to take optional units
* that you meet any unit requirements, such as having completed a related unit in a previous year
* that your optional and mandatory units add up to the correct number of credit points.

### Credit points

Each year, you need to complete:

* 120 credits if you’re a full-time student
* 60 credits if you’re a part-time student

If you're a postgraduate student, you will normally also take:

* a 60-credit dissertation unit

Most units are worth 20 credits, some are worth 40. A small number of units have no credit value.

Usually, students should take 60 credits in each teaching block. If you're taking a [[teaching block 4](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/approve/faqs/tbdefinitions.html/)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/approve/approvalguidance/faqs/tbdefinitions.html/) (TB-4) unit (which runs across the full year), you must take:

* at least 50 credits per teaching block
* no more than 70 credits per teaching block

For full details of the University’s credit framework, see the [Regulations and code of practice for taught programmes (section 4.30)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/academic-quality/documents/taught-code/taught-code-24-25.pdf).

## How to submit your unit choices

You’ll receive an email with a link to a form where you can submit your preferred unit choices. When you’re contacted depends on what type of student you are:

* **new students** will be contacted in August, before your course starts
* **returning students** will be contacted during [teaching block 2](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/dates/) (TB-2)
* **postgraduate taught (PGT) students** on certain programmes, will be contacted in October or November to confirm teaching block 2 units. Your school will let you know if this applies to you.

The email will include the deadline for submitting your form. You must submit it by this date to be considered for your preferred units.

Your school will aim to give you at least one of your top choices. However, unit availability may change due to timetabling, staff availability or demand.

Your school will contact you to confirm your units, or offer alternatives if needed.

The official unit timetable is published in the month before teaching starts. If there’s a timetabling clash at this point, your school will offer you an alternative unit.

## How to change your units

### Before the inital deadline

Contact your [school office](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/faculties/) as soon as possible if you need to make a change. They’ll explain the next steps.

### After the deadline (via the change request process)

You can request a change to your allocated units through the change request process.

Contact your [school office](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/faculties/) as soon as possible, who will:

* email you with details of the process and the deadline to submit your request
* confirm if a change is possible.

You can’t switch to a unit that clashes with one you’re already taking. Spaces are limited, so changes are not guaranteed.

### Change request deadlines for 2025/26

* **TB-1 and TB-4 units:** 5 pm, Friday 26 September 2025.
* **TB-2 units:** 5 pm, Friday 30 January 2026.

Approval to register on a new unit is normally only given within the first two weeks of teaching. This is set out in [Section 12 of the University Transfer Policy](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/study/documents/policies/student-transfer-policy-2025-26.pdf).
