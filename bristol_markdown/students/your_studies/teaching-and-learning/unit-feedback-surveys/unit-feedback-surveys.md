## When to provide feedback

Teaching staff will ask for your feedback at the end of all units.

You may be asked for feedback midway through a unit too.

### Mid-unit

Mid-unit feedback is an opportunity to share your thoughts about the unit with your teaching staff.

This feedback is collected in various ways, depending on the unit.

Giving feedback mid-way through a unit allows teaching staff to:

* understand how students engage with the content,
* reflect on the way they deliver the content.

It also allows you to reflect on what you have learned so far and how you have learned it.

### End of unit

End-of-unit feedback helps you reflect on how you've engaged with the unit and any assessments you may have taken.

You can let us know:

* what worked well,
* and/or where you feel it could have been better.

Your responses help us shape the structure and content of that unit for the future.

## How to provide feedback

Feedback that is respectful, constructive, and fair has the most impact.

* **Be** **descriptive**. “The book by Jones was confusing, and I didn’t think it related well to the course material. More specifically, we were asked to read chapters 5, 8, and 11, but those were not mentioned in the lecture.”
* **Explain** **what you liked about the class**. “I really liked the hands-on activities because they helped me learn the material.”
* **Be polite**. Honesty is important, but there’s no need to be unkind. It is never appropriate to comment on a teacher's personal appearance.
* **Avoid** **criticising things your teacher can’t control**. For example, it’s not helpful to complain that the class is too early in the morning.
* **Offer suggestions**. “I'd find it useful if there were more mini quizzes, with questions to build up our understanding throughout the learning”.
* **Thank your teacher**. If you enjoyed the class, let them know.

### Confidentiality

* Your feedback is confidential.
* Do not name individuals in your feedback.
* Do not identify yourself in your feedback. The University only follows up on individual comments where there is:
  + evidence that you or others are at risk of harm,
  + a breach of our [Acceptable Behaviour Policy](/secretary/student-rules-regs/).

### How to provide feedback using Blue

Most feedback is gathered via a survey tool called Blue.

Some units/schools use other feedback survey tools. If your school is not using Blue, it will let you know how to provide feedback.

* You will receive email invitations from UoB Surveys ([unit-evaluation@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:unit-evaluation@bristol.ac.uk)) with links to the unit survey/s.
* You can view your active surveys in Blackboard (on the home page, Tools menu, Unit Surveys).
* You do not have to answer all the questions.
* Surveys are quick to complete and include a free text section at the end for you to raise anything specific.

If you have any queries email: [unit-evaluation@bristol.ac.uk.](mailto:unit-evaluation@bristol.ac.uk)

### Feedback on small units

Feedback surveys are not generally run for units with less than five registered students. This is because small units often involve regular conversations with teaching staff.

However, if you want to give anonymous feedback, contact your [course rep](/students/life-in-bristol/opportunities/student-leadership-and-representation/) or your [personal tutor](/students/support/personal-tutors/).

## How your feedback is used

Once you have given your feedback, we share the anonymous results with your Unit Director and teaching staff.

They will consider your feedback and use it to help inform decisions about the future teaching and assessment of the unit. They will share their reflections on the feedback received and any actions planned.

After mid-unit feedback, there will often be an opportunity to discuss the results in class.

## Questions about feedback

If you have any questions about giving feedback, email [unit-evaluation@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:unit-evaluation@bristol.ac.uk).
