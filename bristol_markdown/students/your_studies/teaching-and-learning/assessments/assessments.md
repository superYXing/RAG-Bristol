> Information on how and when you will be assessed and how to approach each type of assessment. The type of assessment you have will depend upon the unit taken and your course.

Some assessments contribute to your overall unit or programme mark. Others are used to provide feedback and help you develop your learning and skills.

## Assignments

At the start of each unit, you will be told:

* when an assignment is set
* when it is to be submitted
* when it will be returned to you.

How to apply for an extension to the original deadline and the penalties for late submission will be provided by your school.

Log in to [check your assessment due dates](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/assessment-marks), including extended due dates.

Before you start, make sure you understand whether you are expected to complete your assignment individually or whether group work is allowed.

Assignments can also be in the form of individual or group-based presentations and assess a range of oral or visual communication skills.

## Campus based exams

Campus based exams are held in person, either in teaching time or in the formal university assessment period.

Clear instructions on where these will take place, as well as the expected format will be provided via email in advance.

Your timetable for exams scheduled during the university assessment period will be [available online](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/assessment-marks). Exams outside of this period will be communicated by your school.

## Online exams

Online exams can be held during teaching time or in the formal university assessment periods.

Online exams scheduled during the university assessment period will be [available online](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/assessment-marks). You will be contacted by email when your exam timetable is published.

Take a look at the [online exam advice](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/courses/Study_Skills/online-open-book-exams/index.html).

### Submitting an online exam

Clear instructions on how to finish and submit answers will be provided. For some exams, you may have 30 minutes after the finish time to upload your answers.

Give yourself enough time to submit in case you have any difficulties. Use the practice opportunities if your school provides them.

Test style exams may not auto-submit for you. It is your responsibility to ensure your work has been submitted, following the instructions provided, before the deadline shown.

If you carry on working on the exam beyond the permitted submission deadline or submit your work after the deadline, you will be given a mark of zero.

## Timed assessments

Timed assessments need to be completed and submitted within 3 days (or 4 days if you have [alternative exam arrangements)](/students/support/disability-support/study-support/guide-to-aeas/). They are distinct from written exams delivered online, which have more tightly constrained timing.

Details of your timed assessments will be available [to view online](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/assessment-marks) and you will be contacted via email when they are published.

For timed assessments, students are given guidance as to the amount of time to spend completing the assessment and may choose when to complete the assessment within the given window. There is no additional time allowed for uploading answers and if you do not submit your work to meet the deadline you will automatically receive a mark of zero.

Take a look at the [open book exam advice](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/courses/Study_Skills/online-open-book-exams/index.html).

## Academic integrity

We expect you to maintain the highest standards of [academic integrity](/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/). Action will be taken if any [misconduct](/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/) takes place, including plagiarism, collusion and contract cheating.

## Marking criteria for assessment

Marking criteria are designed to help you know what is expected of you in the assessment and to provide guidance on how your performance may be improved.

Marking criteria may vary dependent on your programme and on the type of assessment you are undertaking. It may be useful to refer to the University's [generic marking criteria](/academic-quality/assessment/regulations-and-code-of-practice-for-taught-programmes/marking-criteria/). Your school will be able to provide you with subject specific marking criteria for your assessment(s).

## Assessment and progress

To progress to the next year of your undergraduate course, you will need to:

* meet the minimum prescribed mark (pass mark) for assessments,
* gain the necessary number of credit points.

Your progress will be discussed by your school and faculty. You can find more about the rules on progression in the [regulations and code of practice for taught programmes](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/assessment/).
