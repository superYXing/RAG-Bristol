> What you can expect from feedback on your work and how to use it.

Feedback on your assessments is an important tool to help your learning and development.

At the start of your units, you will be told:

* what assessments you will receive feedback on (some assessments may be set part-way through a unit)
* when you will receive feedback
* the format of feedback (verbal, written, group feedback).

Feedback may be formal or informal, from your personal or unit tutor, your peers, or a placement supervisor and may be delivered during or after a specific task.

Follow these [instructions to access marks and feedback in Blackboard or Turnitin](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/institution/TEL/TEL%20guides/Student-facing%20guides/WebGuides/Accessing-Marks-and-Feedback-in-Blackboard-or-Turnitin/index.html).

Feedback is not simply a justification for the grade awarded for a particular piece of work. It should also help you to develop and improve and should be transferable to future tasks.

The goal is to give you feedback in time to inform and support the next piece of work, usually within 15 working days of the submission deadline. If this is not possible, a new date will be communicated to you.

You can raise and discuss the forms and timeliness of feedback via the Student-Staff Liaison Committees or in teaching sessions.

## Using feedback

* Make a clear plan for how you will make use of your feedback.
* Look at feedback from previous assignments when you are about to start a new assignment, even if it is on a different unit.
* Identify one or two areas for improvement and [find a workshop](/students/your-studies/study-support/study-skills/) that might help you.
* Make sure you are aware of the marking criteria for your assignment and use them for peer or self-assessment before submission.
