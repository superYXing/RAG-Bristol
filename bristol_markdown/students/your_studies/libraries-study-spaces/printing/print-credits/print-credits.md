> Printing information for students. How to buy print credits and check your balance.

You need print credit to use the printers and copiers at the University.

## Print account

You need a print account before you can add credit. Your print account may not be created until you have sent a document to print. When it’s created we’ll add £2 to your account.

Refunds cannot be given for unused print credit.

## Buy print credit for your account

### Buy credit on the app

To add print credit on the app:

1. Open the app
2. Select the ‘print’ tile
3. Select ‘Top up’

### Online payments

You can also [buy print credit online](https://online-payments.bris.ac.uk/printcredits). You can add credit between £5 and £50 per transaction. You can also pay through the app using the print credits tile.

## Checking your print credit balance

You can check your balance by selecting the ‘print’ tile on the app.

You can also see your current print credit at the top of the touchscreen on a printer, after you sign in and press the ‘print’ button. Your printout costs are shown on the right of the screen.

If you do not have enough credit your documents will not print and you will not be charged.

If a document has not printed, you need to [check that you have sufficient credit](https://print-credits-viewer.services.bristol.ac.uk/).
