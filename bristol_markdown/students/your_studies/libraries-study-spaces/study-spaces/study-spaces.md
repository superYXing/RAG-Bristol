## Teaching space

Rooms are not bookable. Most of the time, the rooms will be available. However, they might get taken by academic staff at short notice.

[Find a teaching space](https://www.bris.ac.uk/where-is-my/find/free-room/table)

1. Search for a room by building to see if the room is free or booked over the next 3 hours. It is a good idea to start your search with the building you are in.
2. You can use the space until a booked event is due to start.
