> Bristol is a great place to get around without a car. You can reach most places easily on foot, by bike or by public transport.

## Maps

* Maps of the University campus are on our [maps and travel](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/maps/google/ "University%20map") page.
* [Visit Bristol](https://visitbristol.co.uk/about-bristol/maps) has maps of Bristol and information where to get hard copies.

## Walking

The University's campuses are quite compact, and you can walk between most buildings in less than ten minutes.

On average, it takes around 40 minutes to walk between the Clifton campus and Temple Quarter. 

Most University buildings are within walking distance of the city centre, Bristol Temple Meads train station and Bristol bus and coach station.

[Visit Bristol](https://visitbristol.co.uk/about-bristol/maps) has maps of Bristol and information on where to get hard copies.

## Cycling

Cycling is one of the cheapest and easiest ways to get around town. Try [Better by Bike](https://cycleplanner.betterbybike.info/route-planning) to plan your route.

Students and staff can access a map showing University cycle parking, cycle repair stations and showers (and directions) on the Visit University of Bristol app. Download from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ombiel.campusm.bristol&hl=en_GB&gl=UK) or the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/university-of-bristol/id6451236995). [More information for staff](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/campus-division/SitePages/Digital-wayfinding-(MazeMap).aspx?_gl=1*mreccd*_ga*MTAxNTQxMzg1Ni4xNjkyMTkzMDg4*_ga_6R8SPL3HLT*czE3NjEzMDgwNDUkbzMyNyRnMSR0MTc2MTMxMjA5NCRqNTEkbDAkaDA.). University of Bristol cycle parking facilities are for daily use only. 

Many of the residences have locked [cycle parking facilities](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/building-services-and-facilities/bike-storage/).

We run initiatives to support and encourage [cycling](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/transportplan/transport/cycling/), including free cycle training and a free cycle clinic to keep your bike in good order.

Join the [University Bicycle User Group](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/transportplan/transport/cycling/tub-bug.html) (TUG-BUG). This is a community of nearly 2,000 cyclists. You can keep up to date with University cycling news, events and initiatives.

## Bus

The Clifton, Temple Quarter and Langford campuses and student residences are linked to the city centre and other places by frequent bus services.

A U1/5/77 bus pass is available for students living in the Stoke Bishop University residences, for the 2025/26 academic year. Find out more about this, and [how to travel around Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/building-services-and-facilities/cars-parking/).

All other students can purchase a bus pass from [First Bus](https://www.firstbus.co.uk/bristol-bath-and-west/tickets/online-tickets) directly.

### Langford Campus (Bristol Vet School)

You can travel to the Langford Campus from Bristol City Centre or the Clifton Campus on the [Unibus U2 Service](https://www.firstbus.co.uk/bristol-bath-and-west/routes-and-maps/bristol-universities/university-bristol).

If you are a Bristol Veterinary School student, and your teaching is based at the Langford Campus, you will get a free bus pass for the U2 service. The pass is given to students at the start of the 2025/26 academic year by the Bristol Veterinary School.

### Discounted student bus fares

All students can get [cheaper bus fares](https://www.firstbus.co.uk/bristol-bath-and-west/your-services/bristol-universities/university-bristol-2025) online or via the First Bus app.

## Train

Bristol has good [train connections](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/transportplan/transport/train/) for getting around the city. [Clifton Down station](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Clifton+Down/@51.4647426,-2.6120978,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48718dc2869ea8c9:0x887b3908caf748d5!8m2!3d51.4647426!4d-2.6099091) is the nearest station to the Clifton campus. [Temple Meads station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4cXEMeJegKbrLre46) is the nearest station to Temple Quarter.

### Student discounts

You can get reduced rail fares with a [16-25 Railcard](http://www.16-25railcard.co.uk/) (also available to full-time mature students).

## Car

We do not recommend students bring a car to Bristol unless it is essential. Bristol is a very congested city and there are many parking restrictions.

There are residential permit areas, meters and time limits in and around the Clifton campus. Temple Quarter is a pedestrianised campus where car parking is limited to disabled spaces and operational vehicles.

Bristol City Council introduced a [Clean Air Zone](https://www.bristol.gov.uk/residents/streets-travel/bristols-caz) in Bristol in 2022. You must pay to drive within the zone if your vehicle does not meet the zone's emission standards, unless you have an exemption.

You could join a [car club](/transportplan/transport/carclub/). They have pay-as-you-go cars located across Bristol.

### Park and Ride Services

If you drive to Bristol, we recommend using a [Park and Ride service](https://travelwest.info/park-ride) instead of driving into the city.

## Electric scooters

[Electric scooters](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/transportplan/transport/e-scooters/) are a common sight across Bristol and a popular way of getting around for many students and staff alike.

To use a scooter, you need to [download the TIER app](https://www.tier.app/en/how-tier-works). This provides information on where to pick up a scooter, where you can to use it, costs, and much more. University staff and students can [apply for a 35% discount](https://intercom-help.eu/tier-mobility/en/articles/93093-uk-access-programme).

## Travelling home in the dark after late teaching

[Advice on personal safety](https://bristol.ac.uk/securityservices/personalsafety/) is available from Security Services.
