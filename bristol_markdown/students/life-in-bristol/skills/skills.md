* reflect on and self-assess your skills

## Reflect on your skills

Use [My Skills](https://mycareer.bristol.ac.uk/leap/svc/skills.html) to assess your ability and experience in the different skills.

* Complete the skills check to see your current skill level. It will take you about 20 minutes.
  + You don’t have to complete the skills check in one go, you can come back to it later.
  + You can retake it as many times as you wish to review your progress.
  + If you score lower on some skills in future assessments, this doesn’t mean you’re getting worse, it is more likely you are making a more accurate assessment.

## Build your skills profile

Once you’ve completed a skills check you can view a summary of your scores against each skill.

* Where you have scored highly, think of examples (within or outside of your studies) of when you have used these skills.
* Record them in your skills log by clicking the **+** icon next to the skill.
* You can view a summary by clicking **skills log**.
* If you complete the skills check more than once, you can compare your results.

## Develop your skills and set goals

Once you have completed the skills check, you can set goals for your academic and personal development.

Pin the skills that you want to focus on first. These could be the ones that are most important to you or that you feel you need the most support in developing.

Go to **pathways** for support in developing that skill further. Click the link next to your skills score or in the **My career passport section**.

## Access after graduation

You can access [My Skills](https://mycareer.bristol.ac.uk/leap/svc/skills.html) for up to three years after graduation.
