> Find out how we support Global Majority students, meaning students from Black, Asian, Arab, Latin-American, Mixed, and Multiple-Ethnic backgrounds.

We are proud to have students from a broad range of countries, backgrounds, ethnicities, faiths and cultures in our community.

We recognise that your identity can shape who you are and how you experience the University, and we know global majority students can sometimes feel unrepresented, isolated and not supported.

We aim to create opportunities for you and improve your experience by listening to you.

## Our commitment to anti-racism

We stand against racism in all forms, and we are committed to tackling racism across the entire institution, including with anti-racism training for staff. We will work with our communities to create long-lasting, positive change. Read more on our work to become an [anti-racist institution](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/anti-racism-at-bristol/).

## Horizons events

Horizons is our university-wide event series which helps Global Majority students:

* create opportunities to find community
* gain new skills
* connect.

Horizons events are only open to students from Global Majority backgrounds. See what's coming up in [the events calendar](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/campus/events/calendar/ "https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/campus/events/calendar/").

### Horizons newsletter

We have a monthly Horizons newsletter to share:

* events
* job opportunities
* useful information.

If you’re a student from a Global Majority background, you’ll automatically be signed up to this.

If you have any questions, contact [horizons-uob@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:horizons-uob@bristol.ac.uk "mailto:horizons-uob@bristol.ac.uk").

## The Race Inclusion Advocate Programme

The Race Inclusion Advocate (RIA) Programme hires Black, Asian, Arab, Latin American, and Multiple Ethnic/Mixed students to partner with services across the university to improve the experience of global majority students have at the University of Bristol.

They work to embed anti-racist practices into university decision-making, partner with services to deliver events, review policy, improve how we communicate with students and educate staff and students on anti-racism and the experiences of global majority students.

## Wellbeing and mental health support for Global Majority students

Research shows that the way institutions talk about mental health isn’t always inclusive to all students. Cultures have different ways they talk about wellbeing and health, and the words and ideas you use to describe your own wellbeing may feel at odds with how the university talks about it.

Regardless of how you describe or view your own wellbeing, the university is working to ensure all wellbeing support understands the needs and experiences of a diverse range of students.

We know that global majority students can have specific experiences and would like the chance to speak to a practitioner who shares their background. We have partnered with Nilaari, a Bristol-based Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic led charity that has been providing culturally appropriate therapeutic services for individuals for twenty-one years.

## Dealing with racism and reporting unacceptable behaviour

We know that racism happens within society, and within our institution. If you, or someone you know, have experienced unwanted actions or behaviour or been treated unfairly, the university has a system for dealing with complaints and issues.

We know it can be difficult to come forward about racism. You may feel like you won’t be believed, feel like going through the process of reporting is too taxing or may not even be sure if what happened was ‘racist’

The first step is finding more about [how the university handles unacceptable behaviour](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/report-unacceptable-behaviour/), so you can make an informed choice about your next steps.

## Finding items, services and groups from your culture in the city of Bristol

We have put together a guide to finding your feet in Bristol so you can find food, services and groups from your culture close to the University. Whether its where to get African groceries, Asian beauty treatments, Black salons or spaces to pray, [check out our guide for finding the best cultural spots in Bristol](https://globalbristol.goodbarber.app/).

There are [spaces to pray and worship](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/multifaith-chaplaincy/places-to-worship/) across the campus.
