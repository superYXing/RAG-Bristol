## Updating your name and other personal details

Find out how to [update your personal details](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/your-record/personal/), including your name and title. You can also add a preferred name to your student record without changing your legal name.

## Wellbeing and mental health support

Our mental health and wellbeing services are trans-inclusive and here to support you.

The Student Counselling Service includes LGBTQ+ counsellors who bring both lived and professional experience with trans and gender-specific issues. We also offer a therapeutic trans support group if you are exploring your gender or transitioning.

You can access these services and request support through [wellbeing services](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/request-support/services/).

## Student support services

We understand that university life can bring many challenges, and our dedicated teams are here to help.

Our [student support services](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/) include academic advice, disability support, student finances, and support with faith or spirituality. Our student support staff receive trans awareness training provided by Gendered Intelligence.

## Student Health Service

The [Student Health Service](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students-health/services/gender-and-sexuality/) is an open, non-judgemental and inclusive service for people that identify as LGBTQ+.  We understand that questioning your gender or sexuality, or dealing with a lack of acceptance from family, can affect your mental health. Our team is here to provide NHS support tailored to your needs. This includes changing your name and gender marker on NHS records, and making referrals to other NHS services including gender clinics.

The Health Service has been awarded the Gold Pride in Practice, awarded by the [LGBT Foundation](https://lgbt.foundation/help/pride-in-practice/) award for their ongoing commitment to LGBTQ+ inclusion.

## Trans and non-binary mentoring programme

If you are a trans or non-binary student, then you could be supported by a mentor with similar lived experience. You [can apply for a mentor](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/opportunities/trans-and-non-binary-mentoring/) at any point throughout your time at university.

## The University of Bristol Students’ Union (SU) Trans Student Society

The [Bristol SU Trans Students’ Society](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/groups/bristol-su-trans-students-network-e52b) offers a welcoming space for all self-identifying trans and non-binary students to connect, campaign, and engage in discussions about trans issues at Bristol. They run frequent social events to help you meet and connect with other trans people.

The Bristol SU also publishes the [Trans Students’ Guide to Bristol](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/articles/trans-students-guide-to-bristol), providing valuable resources and insights.

## Gender Expression Fund

The [Gender Expression Fund](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/student-voice/gender-expression-fund) allows you, as a trans, non-binary, intersex, or gender-diverse individual to apply for up to £100. This is not means-tested and can cover the cost of gender-affirming products or essential travel, according to the fund’s criteria.

## Confidentiality and your data

In accordance with the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and data protection legislation, any disclosure of trans status or identity will be treated confidentially. Explicit consent will be obtained before sharing this information, both within and outside the University, with the implications of withholding consent explained.

We are committed to monitoring student equality data while ensuring anonymity in reporting. We will not disclose numbers of trans students where individuals could be identified. You have the option to withhold this information, but confidential disclosure helps us to monitor the impact of any changes in policy or practices. 

The [Education and Student Experience confidentiality](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/policies/student-services-confidentiality-statement/) statement explains how your information will be handled. We also publish a statement on [how the University use your data](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/secretary/data-protection/policy/students-processing-notice/). All personal data will be processed in line with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.

## Unacceptable behaviour

We are committed to creating an inclusive culture for trans, non-binary, intersex, and gender-diverse members of our university community. Discrimination is not tolerated, and we take unacceptable behaviour seriously.

If you, or someone you know, have experienced unwanted actions or practices that are inappropriate, unreasonable or offensive, [find out how to report it and get support](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/report-unacceptable-behaviour/).
