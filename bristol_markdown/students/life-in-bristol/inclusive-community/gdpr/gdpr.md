> How we use your data when you join a Student Inclusion activity.

When you sign up for a Student Inclusion activity, we will handle the information you provide in line with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018. This means we will collect, store and use your data responsibly, and only for the purposes we explain here.

We will store your information securely and use it to support your involvement in Student Inclusion activities. This helps us to understand how you engage with these programmes, and how you progress through your time at university.

### What we do with your data

We will use your data to:

* administer your participation in the scheme (e.g. sending you relevant resources and event information)
* conduct monitoring, research, and evaluation to understand the impact of our activities
* carry out database analysis and quality assurance.

### Information we collect

For monitoring and evaluation purposes, we will use your student number to retrieve details such as your name, date of birth, and home postcode from the University’s central records system (SITS).

This allows us to understand who is taking part and ensure the support we offer reaches the right people. This information will be uploaded securely to the Higher Education Access Tracker (HEAT) system to help us monitor engagement and evaluate outcomes.

### Who we may share your data with

To help us improve our services and understand what is working, we may share your data with a small number of trusted partners we work with, such as evaluation specialists or researchers. This will only ever be for research, monitoring or evaluation.

These include:

* The Higher Education Access Tracker (HEAT) service and its member institutions
* UCAS
* The Office for Students (OfS)
* The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).

We will never share your data for marketing purposes.

Using the HEAT service allows us and our partners to better understand how students progress through and beyond higher education.

### What we will not do with your data

We will not:

* use your information in a way that identifies you personally in any reports or analysis
* share your information with anyone who is not authorised to access it.

Your privacy and confidentiality are important to us. This data sharing is carried out under the University’s public task as a higher education provider.

### Your rights

You have the right to:

* request a copy of the information we hold about you
* ask us to correct or remove inaccurate data
* withdraw your consent or opt out of data sharing at any time.

To do this, contact [heat-database@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:heat-database@bristol.ac.uk).
