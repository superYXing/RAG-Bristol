> We are committed to creating an inclusive learning community where all students, from all backgrounds have an enriching and stimulating experience.

We work to create an inclusive student community in a number of ways, including specific support for students from underrepresented groups, a strong policy on bullying and harassment, and an institutional commitment to anti-racism. Learn more about the support we offer and how you can be involved in making campus a welcoming environment for all.

## Student Community Induction module

The [Student Community Induction module](https://alt.content.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/orgs/Student_Community/induction-module/index.html) can help you:

* learn about our expectations for our community
* understand behaviours that are not tolerated at Bristol
* find out what you can do to contribute towards a positive community.

## Inclusive support available to all students

### Peer mentoring

[Peer mentoring](/students/support/peer-mentoring/) is a way for new students to receive support from a student in a higher year.

The scheme runs from September until late January and you can apply for a mentor from the time your place at Bristol is confirmed until late November. All first year undergraduate students are eligible. You can ask for your mentor to:

* be of the same gender

* be a mature student
* or another characteristic

### Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS)

[Peer assisted study sessions](/students/your-studies/study-support/pass/) (PASS) are weekly or fortnightly study sessions during teaching weeks, led by trained higher year students, where you can work together with your peers to further you understand of your chosen subject.The study sessions are friendly and informal and open to all students, so they are an ideal way to participate in and become part of your student community.
