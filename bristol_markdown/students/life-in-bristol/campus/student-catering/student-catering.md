> When booking catering for your event, please make sure you follow the below process. Only approved suppliers may be used. This is applicable to all student-led events taking place across the University estate.

If you are organising catering for an event in your school, you must have:

* a valid budget code   
  and
* approval for your event from a budget holder. An approved budget holder within your school will need to place the order for you.

The University works with [approved third-party caterers](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/myerp/SitePages/Purchasing-catering-suppliers.aspx). They have gone through a procurement process ensuring that you’re provided with the best food and service. We also check that they comply with public liability insurance, food standards agency scoring (minimum 4 out of 5) and Fairtrade practice.

Do not use external suppliers. Your event may be cancelled and you will be liable for any costs incurred.
