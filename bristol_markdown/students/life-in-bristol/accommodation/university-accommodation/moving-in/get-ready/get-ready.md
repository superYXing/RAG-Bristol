## Accommodation induction

You must [do the accommodation induction](https://bristol.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortalX/5C5ED1A2/1/1/Home-Home?UrlToken=B93F08C7) in the Accommodation Portal. This explains how to live in your residence safely and how to get support.

## Travel plans

Bristol is busy during arrivals weekend, so allow time for any delays. The [Travel to Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/new/new-international/travel-to-the-uk/) page has guidance for students planning to travel from overseas.

## Bus pass

Some students are eligible for a free bus pass. For bus routes and timetables, visit [Bristol Unibus services](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/building-services-and-facilities/cars-parking/).

## Contents insurance

Your University accommodation insurance policy is listed in your [Residence Guide](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/residence-guides/). You should check the [contents insurance cover](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/rent-contracts-regulations/contents-insurance/) provided meets your needs and arrange additional cover if required.

## Pack bags

We recommend bringing essential items. You can buy more after you arrive.

You should only bring a car if it is essential, for example because of a disability. If you need to bring a car, [apply for a student car parking permit](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/building-services-and-facilities/cars-parking/#student-parking).
