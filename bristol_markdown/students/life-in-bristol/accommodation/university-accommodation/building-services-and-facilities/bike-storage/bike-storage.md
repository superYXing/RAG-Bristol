> Find out where you can store your bike at your residence.

## Bike storage and security

Most University accommodation has designated bike shelters and storage. There are also lots of [bike shelters and racks for you to use around campus](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/maps-and-travel/bike-parking/).

It is your responsbility to ensure that your bike is stored safely and securely using a good security lock. To help ensure the safety of your bike, the University runs a bike security scheme and offer discounted D-lock purchases. Find out more on the [Cycling page](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/transportplan/transport/cycling/#parking).

Bikes are not covered by your [contents insurance](/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/rent-contracts-regulations/contents-insurance/); you will need to pay extra for it. Check your policy and be sure to take out additional coverage if you need it.

Do not store bikes in student rooms, communal areas, corridors or stairwells, as the bikes will be removed.

## Where to store your bike

To find out where you can store your bike in your accommodation, refer to [your Residence guide](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/residence-guides/).

## Removing your bike from the storage area

When you move out of University accommodation, you must also remove your bike from University-owned cycle parking. This applies to your accommodation and to University campuses.

As part of our [Abandoned bikes policy](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/transportplan/transport/cycling/cycle-policies/), we tag and remove any abandoned bikes and put them into storage. If bikes are not collected, we will donate them to the charity, such as LifeCycle in early September.
