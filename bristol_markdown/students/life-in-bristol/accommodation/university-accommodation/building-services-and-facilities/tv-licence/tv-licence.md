> Find out if you need to buy a TV licence for your residence.

You need to buy a TV licence if:

* you watch or record programmes as they’re being shown on TV, on any channel;
* you download or watch BBC programmes on BBC iPlayer;
* you watch or stream programmes live on an online TV service.

This applies on any device, including a TV, laptop, tablet, mobile phone, games console, digital box, DVD/VHS recorder or anything else.

Our residence licence doesn’t cover a student watching TV in their room. The TV licence for your address when you're not at university won’t cover you either.

For more information and to buy a licence, visit the [TV Licensing website](http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/for-your-home/students-aud1).
