## Buses

[Bus travel](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/transportplan/transport/bus/) is a great way to get around in Bristol. Our campuses and certain residences are linked to the city centre and beyond by regular bus services.

You can purchase a bus pass or one-off tickets [from First Bus](https://www.firstbus.co.uk/bristol-bath-and-west/tickets/online-tickets) directly.

### Accessibility

Bristol buses are suitable for disabled people who have sensory impairments, restricted mobility, or use a wheelchair. Let the bus driver know if you need assistance during your journey.

If you are disabled, you can apply for a [Disabled person’s bus pass](https://www.bristol.gov.uk/residents/streets-travel/bus-passes-travelcard/disabled-persons-bus-pass) through Bristol City Council’s website. You must meet certain requirements to qualify.

### Stoke Bishop Campus - U1/5/77 services

The U1/5/77 Academic Year bus pass is available for students living in our University residences in Stoke Bishop .

This bus pass provides free, unlimited travel between most residences, the Clifton Campus and the city centre:

The pass is valid from 12 September 2025 to 30 May 2026.

### Langford Campus - U2 service

You can travel to the Langford Campus from Bristol City Centre or the Clifton Campus on the [Unibus U2 Service](https://www.firstbus.co.uk/bristol-bath-and-west/plan-journey/timetables).

If you are a Bristol Veterinary School student and most of your classes are at the Langford Campus, you will get a free bus pass for the U2 service. You will be given the pass by the Bristol Veterinary School at the start of the academic year.

## Cycling

Cycling is a great way to get from your accommodation to campus. Check the distance between your accommodation and campus on [our residences](/accommodation/about/residences/).

Most University residences have good bike parking facilities. Check the bike storage in your [Residence Guide](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/residence-guides/).

Our [initiatives to support cyclists](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/transportplan/transport/cycling/) include:

* discounted prices on locks and lights,
* regular free cycle maintenance clinics,
* free cycle security marking.

Bicycles are not covered by your [contents insurance](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/rent-contracts-regulations/contents-insurance/), so you may want to buy extra coverage.

Cycle parking in residences is for the length of your tenancy only. We will remove any bicycles left after your tenancy end date. This is under the [Abandoned Bicycle Policy](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/transportplan/transport/cycling/cycle-policies/#abandoned).

## Car parking

You should only bring a car to Bristol if you think driving will be essential. If you need to bring a car, you must [apply for a student car parking permit](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/accommodation/parking/student-parking/).
