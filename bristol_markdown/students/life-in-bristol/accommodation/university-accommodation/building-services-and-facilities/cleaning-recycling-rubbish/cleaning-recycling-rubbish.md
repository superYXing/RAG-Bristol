> Find out how often your residence will be cleaned and where to put your recycling and rubbish.

## Recycling

We provide recycling and composting facilities at all residences. You can recycle:

* paper
* cardboard
* glass
* tins and cans
* plastics
* food waste
* clothes, shoes, fabrics

## Cleaning

The University of Bristol does provide a cleaning support service within all residences.

The day-to-day and weekly cleaning of your accommodation is still your responsibility. This extends to kitchen cleaning, rubbish disposal and washing up.

There is a standard service level that our cleaning staff follow across all residences. We still expect you to play an active role in making sure that all areas are also maintained to meet this standard.

Cleaning support services will be different, depending on where you live.

## Your responsibilities

You need to keep your room and communal areas in a clean and habitable condition.

You must:

* wash the dishes after meals
* use the recycling scheme
* dispose of rubbish bags on a regular basis using refuse waste areas indicated
* keep surfaces, counters and windowsills clean and clear when not in use
* clean all kitchen appliances after use to remove grease, dirt, and food
* clean your room at least once a week.

Read the [guide to keeping your accommodation clean](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/accommodation/media/docs/student-cleaning-expectations-and-guidance.pdf).

### Cleanliness checks

Your accommodation is checked regularly by the facilities managers.

If your flat does not meet our cleanliness standards you will be informed. You may stop receiving:

* normal cleaning support services
* waste and rubbish removal.

These services will resume once you have taken appropriate action to improve the standard of your accommodation.

If your accommodation continues to have an unacceptable standard, you may be charged [for extra cleaning](/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/rent-contracts-regulations/damage/). You may also face action under the [student disciplinary regulations](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/secretary/documents/student-rules-and-regs/student-disciplinary-regulations.pdf).
