> If you are going to be away from your University accommodation for a period of time, you will need to report your absence.

In case of a fire or other emergency, we need to know who is staying in University accommodation at all times. If you are going to be away from your accommodation for any length of time, you must let us know.

To report your absence, complete the form via the [Accommodation portal](https://bristol.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortalX/3B88D738/8/9/Login-Login). You will be asked to state the dates which you have planned to leave and then return to your accommodation.
