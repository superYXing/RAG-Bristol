> What to do if you something in your University accommodation is damaged or not working correctly.

If something in your University accommodation breaks or needs repairing, you need to request a repair online. Follow the instructions in your [Residence Guide](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/residence-guides/).

You should provide:

* your building name
* room number
* details of the problem.

You must report issues as soon as possible so we can help you quickly. If you do not tell us about an issue, [you may need to pay a fee](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/rent-contracts-regulations/damage/) when you move out.

By requesting a repair, you are agreeing that our staff or contractors can get [access to your room or residence](/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/rent-contracts-regulations/staff-access-to-your-room/). Our maintenance staff always carry identification and you should ask to see it.
