> If you are a current student and have lived in University accommodation, we can give you a rent reference.

You may need to give your landlord or letting agent a rent reference before you move into a rented property. This shows that you paid your rent and were a responsible tenant.

Your landlord or letting agent will tell you if they need one.

## Standard rent reference letter

Most landlords and letting agents will accept a standard rent reference. It confirms that you are up-to-date with your rent payments.

You can download and share your rent reference letter from eVision. Check your details, including your tenancy dates. If you see any errors, email [student-services@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:student-services@bristol.ac.uk).

A standard reference does not include [a behavioural rent reference](#behaviour). If you need one, make sure you have read the guidance before submitting your request.

## If a landlord asks for extra information

We can provide a behavioural rent reference letter if your landlord or letting agent asks for extra information.

This includes comments about your behaviour as a student, as well as your rent record.

### How to request a behavioural rent reference

We need your consent if you want a behavioural rent reference.

1. Email [student-services@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:student-services@bristol.ac.uk) from your university email address, with the subject line ‘behavioural reference’. Include:

* your full name
* student number
* the message: “I give the University of Bristol permission to share data about my behaviour and any penalties, for the purpose of a reference."

2. We’ll add information from your university behaviour record.

3. We’ll aim to send your rent reference to your student email address within five working days of you giving consent.

4. You must then share the letter with your landlord or letting agent.

If you have any questions about the data we may share, contact [student-services@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:student-services@bristol.ac.uk).
