## Accommodation needs and adjustments

If your room or residence is unsuitable for your disability, health or another personal factor, you should [tell us your accommodation needs](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/accommodation/apply/your-accommodation-needs/#tell). We could help you get the right adjustments and support.

## Flatmates and neighbours

If you need support with flatmate relationships, feel unhappy or lonely, you can [request wellbeing support](/students/support/managing-student-life/book-an-appointment/). You could also join [social events](/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/events/).

If you are affected by noise, mess or other behaviours from your flatmates or neighbours, check our guide to [being a good neighbour](/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/rent-contracts-regulations/being-a-good-neighbour/). You can [report unacceptable behaviour](/students/support/health/report-unacceptable-behaviour/).

## Repairs

If something is not working in your room or residence, you can [book repairs or maintenance](/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/building-services-and-facilities/repairs/).

## Room cost

If your room cost is too expensive, you can get [money advice](/students/support/finances/advice/) or request funding.

## Complaints

If you are unhappy with your accommodation or the service you have received, you can [make a complaint](/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/rent-contracts-regulations/make-a-complaint/).

## Move rooms

From 20 October 2025, you can [ask to move to a different room](https://bristol.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortalX/3B88D738/8/9/Login-Login) in our University residences.

## Cancel tenancy

If you want to move out of your university accommodation and find a room to rent privately with another landlord, you can [cancel your tenancy](/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/rent-contracts-regulations/cancel-your-tenancy/).
