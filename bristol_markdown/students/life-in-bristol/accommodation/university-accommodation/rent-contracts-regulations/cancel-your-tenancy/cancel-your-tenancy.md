> How to move out of your University accommodation before the tenancy end date.

## On this page

Find out how to end your accommodation contract if you are:

* [Cancelling before you move in](#cancelbeforemovingin)
* [Moving out but continuing to study at the University (including online study)](#movingout)
* [Leaving university or suspending your studies](#leave)
* [Return to university](#returning)
* [Subletting](#subletting)

## Cancel your tenancy before it starts

You may accept a University room offer and then decide to cancel. You can [cancel your accommodation contract](https://bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/moving-in/cancel/) before the tenancy starts.

## Move out but continue to study at the University (including online study)

If you want to move out of your residence before your tenancy contract ends, you must:

* read your tenancy agreement to understand the terms of cancellation
* complete the ‘[Cancel your tenancy](https://starrez.bristol.ac.uk/StarRezPortalX/9679213E/1/2767/Home-Cancel_your_tenancy)’ form, found on your Accommodation Portal home page.

### Rent liability

You are legally responsible for paying rent until the end date of your tenancy. You could be released from your tenancy and rental liability if both:

* you have more than 3 months left on your tenancy
* you find a suitable replacement tenant.

### Replacement tenants

We are not responsible for finding someone who can take over your tenancy.

You must find someone to replace you. You could use the [student bulletin board](https://www.bristolstudentpad.co.uk/MessageBoard) or social media platforms.

The replacement tenant must:

* be a current University of Bristol student who does not already live in University accommodation
  + be a current postgraduate student (if you have a postgraduate tenancy)
  + be current undergraduate (if you have an undergraduate tenancy)
* not be a current pre-sessional student.

### If you found someone to replace you

When you have details of a suitable replacement tenant, you must provide:

* their name
* student number.

Provide this when submitting the ‘Cancel your tenancy’ request on the Accommodation Portal.

​If you haven't yet found a replacement tenant, you can add this information later. Log back into the Accommodation Portal and go to 'Replacement tenant details'.

​You will remain liable for rent on your room until you find a suitable replacement tenant.

When you move out, you will need to pay a £50 charge. This will cover the cost of preparing the room and tenancy for the replacement tenant.

## Leaving university or suspending your studies

You cannot live in a University residence if you have:

* withdrawn from your studies
* suspended your studies.

You must tell us that you are withdrawing or suspending. Do this by completing the ‘[Cancel your tenancy](https://starrez.bristol.ac.uk/StarRezPortalX/9679213E/1/2767/Home-Cancel_your_tenancy)’ form. You can find this form on your Accommodation Portal home page.

You must give us 28 days’ notice that you intend to leave the accommodation.

You will be liable for rent from whichever date is later, either:

* 28 days from the date you submit the ‘Cancel your tenancy’ form  
  or
* the date you leave your accommodation.

## Return to university

If you are suspending your studies, we cannot guarantee you an offer of accommodation when you return.

## Subletting

You cannot sublet (rent out) your accommodation. Anyone found to be living in a room without a tenancy agreement in their name will have to leave.
