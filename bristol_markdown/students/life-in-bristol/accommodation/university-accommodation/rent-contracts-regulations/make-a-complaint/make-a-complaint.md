> If you are unhappy with your accommodation or the service you have received, follow the complaints procedure.

To tell us about a complaint or concern with your accommodation, you must follow this process so we can review and investigate the issue.

We can only investigate concerns raised directly by students. Complaints raised by parents cannot be investigated.

## Step 1: Report the issue

Please email [student-accommodation@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:student-accommodation@bristol.ac.uk) and provide as much detail about the issue as possible.

For [repairs or maintenance issues](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/building-services-and-facilities/repairs/), you must first log your request in the Accommodation Portal, on the 'request a repair or maintenance' page. If you are following up on your request, email [student-accommodation@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:student-accommodation@bristol.ac.uk) and include the date that you initially reported the issue.

We will direct your message to the right team. They will investigate the problem and try to resolve the issue.

We will email you to tell you the outcome. This is the informal stage of our complaints process.

## Step 2: Make a formal complaint

If you are unhappy with the outcome, you can make a formal complaint using the [Student Complaints Procedure (PDF, 269kB)](/media-library/sites/secretary/documents/student-rules-and-regs/Student-Complaints-Procedure.pdf).

You should complete the [Student Complaint Form (Office document, 77kB)](/media-library/sites/currentstudents/documents/Student-Complaint-Form.docx) and send it to [student-complaints@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:student-complaints@bristol.ac.uk). Our Student Complaints and Mediation Manager will refer the complaint to suitable person. They will then consider it at the Local Stage. We will send the outcome of the Local Stage to you in writing.

If you are still unhappy you can progress your complaint to the University Stage.

If your complaint isn't resolve you can complain to the [Office of the Independent Adjudicator](https://www.oiahe.org.uk/students/can-you-complain-to-us/). This is the independent regulator for higher education.
