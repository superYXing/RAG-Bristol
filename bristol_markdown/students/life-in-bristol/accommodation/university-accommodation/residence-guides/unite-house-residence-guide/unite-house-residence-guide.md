## Internet

You will have access to Wi-Fi and an ethernet port in your room. The Wi-Fi provider is Glide.

### How to connect to the internet

When you first arrive at your accommodation:

1. Connect your device to the Wi-Fi network. Search for uS-Glide on your device and enter your Unite Students account details.
2. Open your preferred web browser. If your browser displays a message that the connection is not secure, select **Advanced**, then continue to the website. This is simply your browser flagging that our network is trying to redirect you.
3. If you already have a Glide account, you should enter your username and password and select **Continue**. If you haven't made an account yet, you'll need to select **Get Started** and set up an account with your University email address.

You will automatically opt into the Essential Glide Student account once you set up your account. You can then enjoy up to 1Gbps Internet service (up to 290Mbps on Wi-Fi). Check your settings to find out more information on your connections.

### Issues connecting to the internet

Once you've logged in for the first time, you may be asked to log in again if you're ever disconnected from the internet for a longer period of time. This helps keep your account secure.

If you have any issues connecting, contact Glide on [0333 123 0198](tel:03331230198) or [0333 123 0115](tel:03331230115) (these numbers are monitored 24/7) or email [studentsupport@glide.co.uk](mailto:studentsupport@glide.co.uk)

The Twitter Service Account [@GlideStudentHelp](https://twitter.com/GlideStuHelp) is also active 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

## Laundry facilities and costs

There are two laundry rooms in Unite House. One is located in the front half of the building near to the side exit and bike store, the other is in the back of the building on the right-hand side near the back lift.

Machines operated by Circuit. You can pay for washing facilities using either a top-up card or the Circuit App.

### Prices:

Washing: £3.70  
Drying: £2.30

You need to bring your own washing powder or tablets.

### Drying clothes

You should not dry wet clothes in your room. This causes condensation and mould which can cause health problems, including some potentially serious lung infections.

* Telephone: [+44 (0) 7860 954 058](tel:+447860954058).
