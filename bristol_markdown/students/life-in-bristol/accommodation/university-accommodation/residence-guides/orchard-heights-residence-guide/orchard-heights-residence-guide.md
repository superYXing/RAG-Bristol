## Insurance

Basic personal belongings are insured as part of your accommodation contract.

## Internet

You will have access to Wi-Fi and an ethernet port in your room. The Wi-Fi provider is Glide.

### When you first arrive at your accommodation:

* Connect your device to the Wi-Fi network. Search for uS-Glide on your device and enter your Unite Students account details.
* Next, open your preferred web browser. If you browser displays a message that the connection is not secure, select **Advanced**, then continue to the website. This is simply your browser flagging that our network is trying to redirect you. If you already have a Glide account, you should enter your username and password and select **Continue**. If you haven't made an account yet, you'll need to select **Get Started** and set up an account with your University email address.
* You will be automatically opted into the Essential Glide Student account once you set up your account. You can then enjoy up to 1Gbps Internet service (up to 290Mbps on Wi-Fi). Be aware that some older devices may not be gigabit capable. Check your settings to find out more information on your connections.

Once you've logged in for the first time, you may be asked to log in again if you're ever disconnected from the internet for a longer period of time. This helps keep your account secure and makes sure that no one else is benefiting from the services that you have paid for without your knowledge.

### Issues connecting

Contact Glide on [0333 123 0198](tel:03331230198) / [0333 123 0115](tel:03331230115) (these numbers are monitored 24/7) or email [studentsupport@glide.co.uk](mailto:studentsupport@glide.co.uk).
