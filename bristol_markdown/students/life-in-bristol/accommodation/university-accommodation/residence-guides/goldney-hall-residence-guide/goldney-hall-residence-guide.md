### Sports facilities

There are two tennis courts. No booking is required for these courts, they are run on a first-come-first-served basis. Games should be kept to a one-hour time limit. The tennis courts can also be used for playing basketball or netball. As these courts cut across both of the tennis courts, you must be respectful of keeping playing time down to a minimum if others are waiting to play tennis. If you cause damage to these courts you will be charged for the cost of the repair. If you find that the courts are being used by non-residents, please contact a member of Hall staff.

### Outdoor facilities

There is an on-site garden available for our residents to enjoy but must be respected as listed grounds and so no rugby/football can be played on them.

Goldney House and the Orangery are non-student spaces within the grounds of Goldney Hall. They are used for commercial events and staff accommodation. Please be respectful of people using these spaces and do not enter these areas.
