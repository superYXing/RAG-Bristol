> Joining events in your residence is a great way to meet people, learn skills and have fun.

Your residence has social events throughout the year. View [upcoming events](/students/life-in-bristol/campus/events/) on our website, or follow [@UoBStudentCommunities on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/uobstudentcommunities/?locale=en_GB).

Most events are organised by students living in your residence, including the Junior Common Room (JCR), a committee of elected students.

For information about an event, speak to your JCR. You can also email [student-communities@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:student-communities@bristol.ac.uk).
