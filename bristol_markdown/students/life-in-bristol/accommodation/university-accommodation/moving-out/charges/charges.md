> If you leave your accommodation in a worse state than when you moved in, we will charge you for it.

We will charge you even if you did not mean to cause the damage. We won't charge you for very minor damage caused by normal wear and tear.

## About end of tenancy charges

Charges might include:

* [cleaning and rubbish removal](#cleaning)
* [repainting and repairing damage](#repair)
* [replacing damaged or lost items/fixtures.](#replacement)

While you live in university accommodation, we and our partners function as a landlord. A landlord has a right to charge for the loss of value of an item, even if they do not repair or replace it. A landlord cannot use a charge to make themself better off than they were before.

All charges will include an administration fee of 15% up to £50. For example:

* a broken bin would cost to replace £10. We then add on a 15% administration fee of £1.50. This totals a full charge of £11.50.

### Communal charges

For damage or lack of cleaning communal area, all responsible for that area will share the charge. This is unless one person accepts sole responsibility. For example:

* a damage kitchen table costs £50 to repair. 5 students sharing a kitchen will each £11.50 each (including administration fee).

## Examples

We will usually charge you at the end of your tenancy. We may also charge you mid-tenancy if you do not keep your accommodation to an acceptable standard. Charges will vary based on the costs needed and will cover:

* staff wages and/or contractor costs
* cleaning materials
* disposal charges
* replacement items.

The example charges given are for guidance only. They may exceed given upper limit.
