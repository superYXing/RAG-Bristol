### Partnership properties

If you live in a residence that is managed by one of our partner organisations, they will give you information about moving out, including room inspections, damage charges and how to return your key.

## What you need to do

## Check your tenancy end date

* Your tenancy end date is the date you need to move out by. You will not be able to stay in your room past this date.
* Your tenancy dates are listed in your tenancy agreement which you can access via the [Accommodation Portal](https://starrez.bristol.ac.uk/StarRezPortalX/49BFCF3C/1/1/Home-Home?UrlToken=0157F0EB).
* If you [move out before your tenancy end date](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/rent-contracts-regulations/cancel-your-tenancy/), you will remain liable for rent until the date listed in your tenancy agreement.

## Your room

* Remove all your belongings from your room.
* Check all items listed in the room inventory are in your room.
* Clean the room (and en suite if you have one) thoroughly and remove any rubbish.
* As you leave, take photos of your room and communal areas to help you challenge any potential charges.
* Close any windows and lock your room door as you leave.

## Communal areas

* It is a shared responsibility between you and your flatmates to clean the communal areas in your flat/corridor.
* Clean any shared spaces thoroughly including bathroom and kitchen areas.
* Remove all your belongings from any communal areas or storage cupboards.
* Defrost and clean the fridge-freezer.
* Remove any food and drink from the fridge-freezer.
* Remove any rubbish or recycling.

## Collect post and set up a mail redirect

* You need to collect all your mail and any parcels from your mail room or pigeon holes.
* Any mail delivered after you have moved out will be returned to sender, so we recommend that you [set up a](https://www.royalmail.com/personal/receiving-mail/redirection)[mail redirect with Royal Mail](https://www.royalmail.com/personal/receiving-mail/redirection).

## Remove your bike from the storage area

* If you have a bike, you must remove it from University-owned cycle parking. This applies to your accommodation and to University campuses.
* If you are unsure whether certain cycle parking is University-owned, email [residences-facilities@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:residences-facilities@bristol.ac.uk).
* As part of the [Abandoned Bicycle Policy,](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/transportplan/transport/cycling/cycle-policies/#abandoned) we remove any bikes left on University property each September.

## Return your keys

* As you leave your accommodation, you need to return all your keys, including for your mailbox key if you have one.
* If you’re living in a University-owned residence, you can hand keys in to your [Student Support Centre](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/community/#reslife) or to the Accommodation Manager.
* If you return your keys in the post, you must ensure that it is recorded delivery.

## Donate to Bristol Big Give

* Donation points can be found across campus and in University accommodation.

## Accommodation inspections and charges

After you have moved out, your room and communal areas will be inspected to check that it is clean, no damage has been caused and that no items are missing.

We may charge you if:

* we need to remove anything that you have left behind
* there is any cleaning needed
* there is any damage to your room or communal areas.

You can learn more about these charges on our [End of tenancy charges](/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/moving-out/charges/) page
