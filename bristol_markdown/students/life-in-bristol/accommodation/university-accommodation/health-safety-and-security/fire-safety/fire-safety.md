> We expect you to take responsibility for your safety and be considerate towards other students, staff and visitors. You must read the fire safety regulations and procedures.

## Fire safety equipment in our accommodation

In our student accommodation, we have safety equipment and procedures to help you stay safe from fire, such as:

* 24-hour fire alarm systems
* heat detectors in all kitchens
* smoke detectors in all bedrooms and corridors
* fire blankets in the kitchens
* fire doors in each building
* ‘fire action notices’ in each accommodation
* safe exit routes throughout each building

They are all maintained and tested regularly.

## Fire alarm in our accommodation

The fire alarms are tested at the same day and time every week. You must leave the building quickly if:

* you hear a fire alarm at any other time
* the fire alarm sounds continuously for more than 10 seconds

## Fire evacuation procedure in our accommodation

Read the Fire action notice in your flat or on your corridor. You need to know all the fire exit routes from your room and communal areas.

In case of a fire, you must:

1. leave the building quickly if you hear the fire alarm
2. shut doors behind you as you leave
3. shout 'FIRE’ and tell others as you leave the building
4. take the stairs and do not use the lift
5. go to the fire assembly point and wait for Security Services
6. if you know it is a real fire, dial 999 and ask for the fire service
7. tell  Security Services what you know; for example, if it's a real fire, where the fire is and if anyone is still in the building
8. do not re-enter the building until a staff member or the fire service tells you it is safe to enter

## Fire assembly point

The fire assembly point for your accommodation is listed in your [residence guide](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/residence-guides/) and on fire action notices.

## Disciplinary action

Any student that causes risk to others’ safety will face disciplinary action. In some cases, you may also receive a fixed penalty and/or face legal action from enforcing authorities.

Actions which may result in disciplinary action, include:

* propping open or disabling fire doors
* leaving your cooking unattended
* covering or tampering with fire or smoke detectors
* failing to report a covered or tampered with fire or smoke detector
* malicious and false fire alarms
* damaging fire alarm systems
* failing to leave the building quickly when the fire alarm rings
* returning to the accommodation before being given permission by
* a staff member or the fire service
* blocking fire exits or covering fire safety signs
* damaging or misusing fire-fighting equipment
* possessing fireworks and/or using naked flames (including candles, tea lights, incense or similar items)
* bringing flammable items (including foam filled furniture or curtains into the accommodation)
* placing clothes on or near space heaters
* leaving hair tongs on the carpet or any other flammable surface
* smoking cigarettes or vaping inside

This list is not complete.

## How to reduce false fire alarms

We recommend:

* when using the shower, ensure the ventilation fan is switched on
* keep the bathroom door closed as steam may activate the fire alarm
* turn off the ventilation fan after you have showered, if possible
* keep the kitchen door closed while cooking
* get your electrical equipment PAT ([electrical safety](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/health-safety-and-security/electrical-safety/)) tested
* report any faulty fire doors straight away by [requesting a repair or maintenance](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/building-services-and-facilities/repairs/).
