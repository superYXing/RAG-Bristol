## About accommodation needs

Some students need accommodation that has specific facilities or adaptations.  This could be due to disability, health, religion or another reason.

Your accommodation needs could include:

* a studio, adapted or accessible room due to disability
* an en suite room due to disability, health or religion
* catered accommodation due to disability, health or religion
* self-catered accommodation due to disability, health or religion
* a fridge in your room, for the storage of medicine
* no carpets due to allergies
* a gender-neutral bathroom due to gender identity
* a larger bed due to your height.

Most residences do not have staff working in them.

### Adapted or accessible rooms

If you use a wheelchair, we could offer an accessible room with:

* power-assisted doors
* wheelchair accessible lifts
* low-level kitchen work surfaces
* accessible storage
* wet rooms equipped with shower chairs, handrails and emergency pull cords.

If you are deaf or have a hearing impairment, we could offer a room with a fire alarm that uses: 

* flashing lights
* vibrating pillows.

If you are blind or have a visual impairment, we could offer a studio room with: 

* a talking microwave
* adapted hob
* bump corners.

If you have an [assistance dog](/accommodation/apply/your-accommodation-needs/assistance-animals-in-residences-/), we could offer you a suitable room.

## Tell us your accommodation needs

If you have accommodation needs, you need to tell us when you [apply for accommodation](/accommodation/apply/). We will prioritise your accommodation needs above your other preferences.

If your room is unsuitable when you arrive or your needs change after you apply for accommodation, contact [student-accommodation@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:student-accommodation@bristol.ac.uk).

We try to make sure everyone has suitable accommodation, but due to limited availability this is not always possible.

Any information you share with us is treated sensitively in accordance with our [Confidentiality Statement](/students/support/health/policies/student-services-confidentiality-statement/).

## Emergency evacuation support

If you need support or specific arrangements during the emergency evacuation of a University building, you can [request a Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan](/accommodation/apply/your-accommodation-needs/peep/) (PEEP).

## Rent reduction for disabled students

Check if you can get [rent reduction for disabled students](/accommodation/apply/your-accommodation-needs/rent-reduction/).
