> Our electrical safety regulations and procedures are here to help you stay safe in your accommodation. Find out how to avoid electrical faults, and how to report them.

## Report an electrical fault

If you think an item of University property has an electrical fault, you must:

1. switch it off at the plug

2. [log in to your Accommodation Portal](https://bristol.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortalX/4ABC5D33/1/1/Home-Home?UrlToken=5A9A1816)

3. follow the steps on the 'Request a repair or maintenance' page.

Do not try to repair any electrical equipment yourself.

## Avoid electrical faults

To stay safe and avoid electrical faults in your accommodation, you must not:

* use frayed or damaged leads, plugs or casing, where wiring is exposed
* use electrical appliances that do not have a fuse
* leave electrical equipment on when you are not using it, especially when you are out of your room
* put metal into a toaster or microwave when it is plugged in
* hang wet clothes over electrical appliances, such as a heater
* use a vacuum cleaner to clean up anything wet.

## Your electrical equipment

You can bring electrical equipment into your accommodation that is:

* British Standard approved (look for the BSI kitemark)
* correctly wired
* suitable for the UK's electricity supply (220-224 volts).

You are responsible for its safety. We also have a legal right to inspect your electrical equipment. If we believe it is dangerous, it will be removed.

All electrical equipment should be PAT tested to ensure it is safe to use. To arrange a free PAT test, contact [residences-facilities@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:residences-facilities@bristol.ac.uk).

Do not use electrical equipment in the bathroom, unless it is designed for that purpose.

### Extension cables

If you have an extension cable, you must:

* only use one lead per socket
* never load it with more than 13 amps
* position cables carefully to avoid tripping hazards.

### What you cannot keep in your room

These electrical items are not allowed in your room:

* heaters
* fridges (if you need one for medical reasons, we will provide you with a suitable model)
* multi-socket adaptors.

These items will be removed from your room and put into storage.
