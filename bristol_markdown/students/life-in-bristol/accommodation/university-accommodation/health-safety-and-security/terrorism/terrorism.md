> In the event of a terrorist attack, you need to be responsible for your own safety and the safety of those around you. Ensure that you have read and understood the correct procedures.

## Life-threatening emergency

Call **999** immediately or [go to your nearest hospital](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/hospital/).

### After calling 999

**If you are on campus** call Security Services on [0117 331 1223](tel:0117 3311223).

## Dealing with a terrorist threat in your university accommodation

The National Police Chiefs’ Council has given a clear procedure for what you should do in the event of a terrorist threat. If you are in immediate danger of harm from an individual:

#### 1. Run

Run to a place of safety. This is a far better option than to surrender or negotiate. If there’s nowhere to go, then you should try to hide.

#### 2. Hide

It’s better to hide than to confront. Remember to turn your phone to silent and turn off vibrate. Barricade yourself in if you can. Once it is safe, you should call the police.

#### 3. Tell

Call the police on 999.

[Watch the short film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUCW_mk35Xc&t=5s) by the National Police Chiefs Council highlighting three key steps (Run, Hide, Tell) for keeping safe in the event of a firearms or weapons attack. There is also a [guidance leaflet](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/securityservices/RUNTELLHIDENPCC_CT_A5%202pp.pdf) highlighting these steps.

## Bomb threats

No matter how unbelievable a bomb threat may seem, any threat is a crime and should be reported to the police by dialling 999.

It is important to be familiar with evacuation routes and assembly points in your residence. The emergency assembly point for your accommodation is listed in your [Residence Guide](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/residence-guides/).

Follow [our guidance](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/securityservices/documents/Bomb_Threats_Checklist%202.pdf) if you receive a bomb threat.

## Suspicious packages

If you receive or find a package that you believe may constitute a threat, follow the four C’s protocol:

1. **Confirm** whether the item exhibits recognisably suspicious characteristics.
2. **Clear** the immediate area.
3. **Communicate** the threat by calling security immediately for advice.
4. **Control** access to the area.

## In your residence

Each residence has safety equipment and procedures in place to help keep you safe, such as:

* 24-hour fire alarm systems,
* Heat and smoke detectors in all kitchens,
* Safe exit routes throughout each building.

They are all maintained and tested regularly to ensure the safety of all students.
