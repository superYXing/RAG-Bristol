> We can provide short-term accommodation for students who need somewhere to stay in an emergency.

You may need short-term emergency accommodation because:

* a sudden unforeseen catastrophe means you cannot stay in your usual accommodation. This may include:
  + fire
  + flood
  + gas leak
  + something else
* you are worried your personal safety is at risk if you remain where you are.

You cannot request emergency accommodation because of money problems. If you are struggling with accommodation costs, [contact Student Funding](https://bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/emergency-funds/) for help.

## What to do

If you need emergency accommodation because you are worried about your personal safety, [contact our Wellbeing services](https://bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/request-support/) and they will support you.

If they feel that you need emergency accommodation, they will contact Student Accommodation.

If you feel that you need emergency accommodation for any other reason, please contact Student Accommodation on [+44117 456 9860](tel:+441174569860) or email [student-accommodation@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:student-accommodation@bristol.ac.uk).

Outside normal working hours, please contact the Residential Wellbeing team on [+44(0)117 428 3300](tel:+441174283300). This line is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

## What happens next?

We will consider your circumstances and confirm whether we are able to provide you with emergency accommodation.

If we are able to offer you emergency accommodation, we will confirm:

* the location of the emergency room
* the cost (usually around £25 per night)
* the length of stay (usually 1 or 2 night or, in rare cases, up to 1 week).
