> Returner accommodation is for students who have either previously studied at the University or have previously lived in University accommodation for any length of time.

## Who can apply?

We prioritise students who have a significant housing need, including:

* students who have a disability or health condition
* students with care experience
* estranged students
* International Foundation Programme students
* students from refugee or asylum-seeking communities.

If you have any circumstance that affects where you can live, include it in your application. We will prioritise you, but cannot guarantee a room offer due to availability.

You can apply if:

* you are a current student
* you have previously studied at the University of Bristol, for any length of time, either online or in person
* you have previously moved into University accommodation, for any length of time.

### International Foundation Programme (IFP) students

If you are an IFP student due to start your main programme of study, you are guaranteed an offer of returner accommodation.

You must apply by the application deadline. If you apply after the deadline, you will not get a University accommodation offer and will need to find a private room instead.

## Room availability

There are only a few University rooms available for students after first year. You should also look for [private sector accommodation](/accommodation/privately-rented/finding-private-accommodation/) alongside your returner application.

### Location of rooms

Rooms for returning students are spread out across our University residences. We do not have residences specifically for returning students, so you may be in a flat with new students.

## How to apply

We expect applications for 2026/27 to open in spring 2026.
