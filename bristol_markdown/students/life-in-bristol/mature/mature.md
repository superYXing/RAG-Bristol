> Information and support for mature and part-time students at Bristol.

We have a dedicated Student Inclusion Officer and a team of Mature Student Advocates who can help you settle in and make the best possible start at University. They will be there to support you throughout your studies.

You will also have support throughout your course from someone in your department, such as [a personal tutor](/students/support/personal-tutors/ "Personal%20tutors") who is there to help you. You can also access support from a range of services. This includes both [study support](/students/your-studies/study-support/) and [personal support](/students/support/).

If you are starting in September, you can request a [peer mentor](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/study/peer-mentoring/) to help you in the first few months of the year. Make sure you read the rest of our [information for new students](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/new/) too.

## Events

We run a range of events and activities for mature students throughout the year. View [the events calendar](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/campus/events/calendar/#start_date=2025-07-01;end_date=2026-07-01;categories=677655870) to see upcoming events.

#### Transition and welcome events

We run a series of transition and welcome events for mature students in early to mid September. These include:

* social activities
* study skills sessions
* community building activities.

#### Mature student mingles

Mingles are an opportunity to meet with other mature students, Mature Student Advocates and the Mature Students Inclusion Officer.

They will also give you valuable opportunities to find out more about different aspects of the University, such as careers and funding etc.

It's a great opportunity to meet other students across all years, take a breather and build the mature student community. You can ask questions, chat and share experiences in an informal setting.

These events are open to all students in all years. There will always be refreshments available and you can drop in at any point during the session.

Mingles are monthly during term time and are listed on [the events calendar](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/campus/events/calendar/#start_date=2025-07-02;end_date=2026-07-02;categories=677655870).

#### Blackboard group

The [Mature Students at University of Bristol Blackboard group](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/execute/announcement?method=search&context=course&course_id=_243613_1&handle=cp_announcements&mode=cpview) includes useful information to support your studies such as resources from the sessions we run.

The resources are aimed at Foundation and UG students. You'll also get regular newsletter updates via this group.

If you think you don't have access and would like to be added, email [mature-students-adviser@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:mature-students-adviser@bristol.ac.uk).

#### Individual appointments for current students

Maria, the Mature Students Inclusion Officer offers one-to-one coaching and support appointments throughout the year. This provides an opportunity to work through any concerns and to help you access support.

You can choose to meet in person, online (Microsoft Teams) or just to talk on the phone.

Current students can book an appointment with Maria via the [Booking System](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/c80e54aae65a45e1870ad1c8e8d78f78%40bristol.ac.uk?anonymous), or email [mature-students-adviser@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:mature-students-adviser@bristol.ac.uk) to arrange an appointment. 

## Mature Student Advocates

Mature Student Advocates are current students who are available to act as peer mentors to first-year students. They work closely with the Student Inclusion officer to co-create and run events and activities to help improve the mature and part-time student experience at University.
