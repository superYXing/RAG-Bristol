> Outreach provides capacity building and awareness raising activities to areas of the community who might not otherwise have knowledge or access to University.

Volunteering is any activity that involves spending time, unpaid, doing something that aims to benefit the environment or community. Opportunities include practical and skills-based volunteering, as well as remote and one-off volunteering opportunities.

You can reflect on, record, and develop the skills you are learning through volunteering [in My Skills](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/skills/)**.**

## Examples of the types of opportunities available include:

### Volunteering in schools

There are lots of opportunities for you to make a difference to young people in the local community. Volunteering opportunities might involve leading sports coaching sessions, being a tutor or simply acting as a role model to someone from a similar background to you.

### Volunteering with the elderly

Isolation can be a big problem for elderly people living alone in the community. Volunteering with the elderly might involve visiting an elderly person in their home to provide company or helping to organise social events such as trips or tea parties.

### Volunteering outdoors on environmental projects

Bristol was the European Green Capital in 2015. There still exists a legacy of sustainability in the city, and the University recently declared a climate emergency. So if you like being active and taking part in practical activities, there are many ways to get involved. From cleaning the Bristol harbourside to community gardening to helping to maintain the city parks and green spaces.

### Volunteering for a cause

You may want to volunteer for a cause that you are passionate about already, or you may want to explore and discover new causes. In the past there have been opportunities to support sustainable fashion, tackle homelessness, reduce food waste, conserve hedgehogs and fundraise for health charities.
