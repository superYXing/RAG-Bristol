> How to get support and guidance from a current student in your first term, through our peer mentoring programme.

Applications to request a peer mentor for 2025/26 are closed.

## Peer mentoring programme

You can get one-to-one support and guidance from a current student if you are in your first term and a:

* first year undergraduate  
  or
* Gateway or Foundation student.

The programme runs from the start of the academic year in September until January.

## How the mentor can help you

A peer mentor is a current student at the university, usually within their second or third year.

They can help by:

* offering advice based on their experiences
* introducing you to relevant university services
* informing you of societies and events
* recommending you local facilities and attractions.

Mentors cannot provide academic or mental health support but will put you in touch with services that can. For academic peer support, [see our PASS programme](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/your-studies/study-support/pass/ "https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/your-studies/study-support/pass/").

They also cannot do certain activities with you but this will be explained during your first meeting.

## Pairing students and mentors

Where possible, we aim to match new students to mentors studying a similar subject to them. However, you may choose to be matched based on a protected characteristic, such as:

* LGBTQ+ identity
* neurodiversity
* faith, ethnic or cultural background
* care leaver or estranged student status
* mature student status.

## How to become a peer mentor

Applications to become a peer mentor for 2025/26 are closed. We will reopen applications in January 2026.
