> You University account gives you access to online tools to support your studies.

## University account

An account is set up for you after you have [confirmed your registration details](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/new/before-you-arrive/register/). We will give you a username and password so you can access online systems and services.

## Username

The University username format is ab12345, made up of:

* Two letters
* Two digits for the year in which the account is created
* Three numerical digits.

When signing into [Outlook email or other Microsoft 365 services](/students/support/it/software-and-online-resources/) you should submit your username with the '@bristol.ac.uk' included eg. ab12345@bristol.ac.uk

## Password

To access most online services you will need to use your University username and password.

You can [change your password](/it-services/password/) (UoB only) at any time. If you forget your password, you can reset it online using the [Password Reset tool](https://pwr.isys.bris.ac.uk/cgi-bin/reset.pl).

Never use a password you have already used somewhere else. Your password must be unique to the University.

## Email

Access your email using [Outlook](https://outlook.com/bristol.ac.uk). We send many communications to your University email address. You need to check your email often (daily in term time).

Your email address uses your username, e.g. ab12345@bristol.ac.uk and you cannot change this. You can create a [user-friendly version of your email address](https://www.bris.ac.uk/it-services/applications/mailname/mailname.html) for others to contact you while you are a student.

## Multi-factor authentication

You will be asked to set up multi-factor authentication, which adds an extra layer of security to your University account.

[Set up multi-factor authentication](/infosec/mfa/).

## Single Sign-On service

You will use your University username and password to access most services, many of which use Microsoft authentication and the associated [multi-factor authentication](/infosec/mfa/) process.
