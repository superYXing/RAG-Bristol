> You will have access to a range of software and tools that will enable you to communicate and study with others.

We aim to provide you with software and tools to enable you to study, communicate and collaborate with lecturers and fellow students.

## Microsoft Office 365

Some software is available for personal use either for free or at a reduced cost once you are a registered student.

* Microsoft Office 365 is available for free to install on up to five personally owned devices. This is the full version of Office, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote and OneDrive for Business. Install Office 365.
* OneDrive for Business for document storage and sharing.
* Microsoft Teams for instant messaging, video calls and collaborative working.

This and other course-specific specialist software is available once you have registered with us (normally a week or so before the start of your course).

Follow the [Microsoft 365 instructions for installing software](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/download-install-or-reinstall-microsoft-365-office-2024-or-office-2021-on-a-pc-or-mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658).
