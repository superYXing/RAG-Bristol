> Students living in England and Wales can apply for a postgraduate doctoral loan. This can help with your programme fees and living costs while studying for a postgraduate research degree.

## How much you can borrow

The postgraduate doctoral loan is not means-tested.

It varies depending on when your programme starts and the year of study in which you choose to apply.

For students starting in 2025/26, the loan amount you can apply for can be:

* up to £30,301 if you normally live in England
* up to £29,130 if you normally live in Wales.

You can use the loan as you wish towards any costs associated with study.

## Budgeting

The loan will be divided equally across each year of your programme. Your programme length is the maximum period of study based on the type of research programme and on the mode of attendance. Visit section 4.7 of the [regulations and code of practice.](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/pg/code-of-practice/information/study-period/#minimum-maximum)

It will be paid into your bank account in three instalments each academic year.

The loan length you apply for should match your programme length on your offer letter.

Programmes can be full or part-time and last between three and eight years in length. If your programme is extended beyond eight years, you may become ineligible for funding.

You will stop receiving your loan if you withdraw from your studies or transfer to an ineligible programme. You will still have to repay what you have borrowed.

### Scotland and Northern Ireland

If you are a UK national, or have settled status, living in Scotland or Northern Ireland, you are not eligible for the postgraduate doctoral loan.

## How to apply

You can apply for your loan during any year of your programme. The latest you can apply is nine months after the start of the last academic year of your programme.

## Repayment
