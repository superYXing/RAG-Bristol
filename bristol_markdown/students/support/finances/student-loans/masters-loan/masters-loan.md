> Students living in the UK can apply for a postgraduate master's loan. This funding can help with your course fees and living costs while studying for a master's degree, such as an MA or MSc.

## How much you can borrow

The loan is not means-tested.

For eligible students, the amount you can borrow varies depending on where you normally live in the UK . Moving somewhere to study does not count as normally living there.

### For 2025/26:

* Students living in Scotland will be assessed by The SAAS will ordinarily only fund postgraduate students from Scotland to study at an institution in Scotland. In exceptional circumstances, they may fund study outside Scotland if the course is not available in Scotland.

If you are studying for two, three or four academic years, the loan will be divided equally across each year of your course. Studying part-time may affect your eligibility for funding. Contact your funding provider or speak to the Money Advice team for more information.

You will receive the first payment after your course start date, once your institution confirms that you have registered. The loan will be paid in three instalments throughout the academic year.
