> Undergraduate students from the UK can access funding from the government. This is made up of a tuition fee loan and a maintenance loan to help cover living costs.

## How much you can borrow

### Tuition fees

Tuition fee loans of up to £9,535 per year are available for UK students who are starting a full-time undergraduate course at the University in 2025/26. This loan is paid directly to the University to go towards your tuition fees.

### Living costs

Maintenance loans help with your living costs, such as food, accommodation and travel. This loan is paid directly into your bank account 3 to 5 working days after the university has confirmed your registration to the Student Loans Company.

For 2025/26, students funded by Student Finance England can borrow:

* up to £8,877 if you live at home while you study
* up to £10,544 if you live away from your family home.

Use the [student finance calculator](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance-calculator) to estimate how much maintenance loan you could receive.

For students from [Wales](https://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/undergraduate-students.aspx), [Scotland](https://saas.gov.uk/) or [Northern Ireland](https://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk/), refer to your government website.

#### Special support maintenance loan

As a full time undergraduate student, you may qualify for more maintenance loan if you meet one of these criteria:

* have a disability and qualify for the Disability Living Allowance, Disability Premium or Severe Disability Premium.
* qualify for Personal Independence Payment or Armed Forces Independence Payment
* are deaf and qualify for Disabled Student Allowance.
* have been treated as incapable of work for a continuous period of at least 28 weeks.
* have a disability and qualify for income-related Employment and Support Allowance.

living circumstances related:

* are a single parent or single foster parent of a child or young person under 20 who is in full-time education below higher-education level or on an approved training course
* have a partner who is also a full-time student and one or both of them is responsible for a child or young person under 20 who is in full-time education below higher-education level or on an approved training course.

If you qualify for this loan, you can apply for it in your student finance application form.

### Part-time study

Part-time undergraduate students can apply for funding from Student Finance England, if:

* you are studying over 25% of the full-time course in each year
* you do not have a degree qualification already.

If you started your course in or after August 2018, you can apply for a tuition fee loan and maintenance loan. If you started your course before August 2018, you can apply for a tuition fee loan only.
