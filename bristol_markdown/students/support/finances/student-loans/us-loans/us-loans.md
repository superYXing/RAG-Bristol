> If you are a citizen or national of the United States, and wish to study at Bristol, you may apply for federal or private student loans.

There are two main types of of US loan you an apply for:

* [US federal loans](/students/support/finances/student-loans/us-loans/federal/)
* [US private loans](#private)

We cannot offer [Veterans affairs benefit](#veterans) for study at Bristol.

## US federal loans

We are approved to certify student loans from the US federal government, known as "title IV loans". Further information is on our [US federal loans page](/students/support/finances/student-loans/us-loans/federal/).

## US private loans

Some students from the United States may be are unable to take out US federal loans. These students can still borrow from private lenders in the US.

US students may not be able to take out US federal loans because they:

* do not meet certain criteria
* wish to study a course which is not approved for federal US loans
* are on distance learning courses based in the US but enrolled on a UK degree course at Bristol.

If you are eligible for US federal loans, you should look at these before applying for a private loan. Federal loans are often cheaper and most US students are eligible for them. Private loans do not let you to borrow more than federal loans.

## How to apply for a private loan

If you wish to apply for a private US student loan, email [us-loans@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:us-loans@bristol.ac.uk). From May onwards, the Student Funding Office will email you a Cost of Attendance (CoA). This will tell you of the amount you are able to borrow.

We will seek to work with whichever private lender you use. We are currently most familiar with [Sallie Mae](https://www.salliemae.com/student-loans/) and [Earnest](https://www.earnest.com/). No more than 365 days can pass from the loan period end date to the first instalment through these lenders.

You should compare the terms, charges, and interest rates before taking out a private loan.

## Receiving your private loan

We will certify your application once you have registered at the University. We will request the loan to be payable in one instalment, used to pay your tuition and accommodation fees. Any remaining funds will be sent to you using the banking details you give us. For UK bank accounts, first check with your bank that they accept USD payments.

## Veterans affairs benefit

In the past, the University of Bristol was an approved-provider of VA funding and benefits. This offer came from the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

However, we no longer process VA funding for students starting from the 2023/24 academic year onwards.

If you are a VA-funded student who started before this date, we will continue working with the VA to assist the provision of your funding. However we cannot guarantee your funding will continue as before.

If you have any questions, email [us-loans@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:us-loans@bristol.ac.uk).
