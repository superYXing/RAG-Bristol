Budgeting and managing your day-to-day living costs are important life skills to learn.

Getting started with this may feel overwhelming, especially if this is the first time you have been entirely responsible for managing your finances. However, there is support available.

## Budgeting calculator and planner

Create your budget with our [student budget calculator (Office document, 47kB)](/media-library/sites/students/documents/student-budget-calculator.xlsx).

Enter the money you have coming in and estimate your outgoings to get an idea of how much money you could have left over.

Our budgeting planner breaks down expenses into the categories that students typically spend money on.

You will have some essential costs, such as accommodation, bills, food, travel and course costs. Other costs are more flexible and include hobbies, entertainment and clothing. With a budget, you will know how much you can afford to spend on these non-essential expenses.

## Living costs in Bristol

We spoke to a range of students in the 2024/25 academic year to ask them about their cost of living as a student in Bristol. This revealed that the average monthly spend is around £1,221. This is made up of:

* rent and bills (£810)
* living and personal costs, including food, toiletries, study costs and transport (£233)
* hobbies and leisure (£179).

[Save the Student](https://www.savethestudent.org/money/student-budgeting/what-do-students-spend-their-money-on.html) have also put together some useful guidance on what students tend to spend money on each month.

Accommodation will be one of your biggest monthly expenses. Find out the [fees for different types of university halls](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/accommodation/about/costs/) and [private rented costs](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/accommodation/privately-rented/finding-private-accommodation/private-renting-costs/) and what you need to budget for including rent, council tax and bills.

Living costs will vary depending on individual circumstances.

## Budgeting tips

### Save money for special occasions and unexpected costs

Save a little each month to help with special occasions, such as Christmas or birthdays, or unexpected costs like your laptop breaking.

### Keep your spending money and savings in separate accounts.

Once you know how much you have to spend each week, you can transfer this money to a separate account from your savings. This will prevent you from accidentally spending the money you need for essential items.

### Choose an app-based bank account for help with budgeting

Many app-based bank accounts allow you to set spending goals and categorise your spending.

Read about the [best app-based banks for budgeting](https://www.savethestudent.org/money/best-digital-app-banks.html) by Save the Student.

### Use online or mobile banking

Manage your finances online to track your spending patterns and monitor your bank balance.

### Always open your post and read your emails

Deal with bills and statements straight away. If you miss a regular direct debit payment, this can affect your credit rating. Contact your bank or the relevant company immediately.
