You may be thinking about suspending or withdrawing from your studies for financial reasons. If so, you should contact the Money Advice and Funding Team. They can discuss possible financial support with you.

We offer [emergency and hardship funds](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/emergency-funds/) for students who are experiencing financial difficulty.

## Financial impact of suspending or withdrawing

### Eligibility for student funding

If you are a home-fee-paying undergraduate student, studying your first degree. You are eligible for student funding for the duration of your course plus one year if you are:

* a home-fee-paying undergraduate student
and* studying your first degree.

For example, if you are studying a three-year BSc, you are entitled to four years of funding.

Suspending or withdrawing can impact on your funding if you return to study.

You will receive full funding when you return to study if:

* You haven not already used up your "plus one" year of funding
and* you do not have any previous years of study before starting the course.

If you have used up your "plus one" year of funding , you would be eligible for a maintenance loan only when you return. You would be eligible not a tuition fee loan.

### Repaying tuition fees and maintenance loan

Your student finance provider will adjust your entitlement based on your last attendance date. They will work out any overpayment you may have received. They will then contact you to discuss repayment.

If you do not repay, they will deduct your overpayment from the funding you are due to receive in future years. The Money Advice and Funding Team can help you complete an SFE Hardship Fund form. This overpayment will then be moved from year to year.

When you suspend or withdraw, your tuition fee liability will be worked out again using your last attendance date. This table applies to most undergraduate courses at the university. Be aware that some students will be subject to a different refund policy. Students studying for a PGCE should refer to their school policy.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Your last date of attendance** | **% of tuition fee liability** | **% of tuition fee refunded** |
| First two weeks of 1st term | 0% | 100% |
| Third week of 1st term to before start of 2nd term | 25% | 75% |
| On or after start of 2nd term to before start of 3rd term | 50% | 50% |
| On or after start of 3rd term | 100% | 0% |

## How to suspend or withdraw from your studies

You should read our full guidance on [withdrawing from](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/withdraw/) or [suspending your studies](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/suspend-your-studies/).

Once we have confirmed your suspension or withdrawal, we will inform your student finance provider of your last day of attendance. The student finance provider usually takes around six weeks to process this change of circumstances. After this point, they will get in touch with you about any overpayments you have received. This includes any maintenance loan payment you have received that covers beyond your last date of attendance. You may also receive your next maintenance loan instalment during these six weeks. In this case you will need to repay in full.

You can keep 60 days’ worth of overpayment of maintenance loan if your suspension is due to:

* ill health
* pregnancy.

These 60 days are counted from your last day of attendance.

## Returning to study

You should apply for student finance as early as possible before you return to study to avoid delays.

When you return after a suspension, the tuition fee loan will usually be calculated on a pro-rata basis. You should get the full maintenance loan. This is because you will remain on a full-time course code, even if you are studying as a part-time variable student. Do not apply for part-time student finance funding. If you are registered part-time on your supplementary year, apply for full-time funding as normal.

Think ahead about where you will live on your return. If you are struggling financially on your return to study, you may wish to apply to the [Financial Assistance Fund](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/fees-funding/awards/faf/).
