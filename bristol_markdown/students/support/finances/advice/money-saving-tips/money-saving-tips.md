## Create a budget

A budget can help you prioritise your spending and avoid future financial difficulties.

Use our helpful [student budget calculator (Office document, 47kB)](/media-library/sites/students/documents/student-budget-calculator.xlsx) to plan your finances.

Visit our [budgeting and living expenses page](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/advice/living-expenses/) for help managing your money.

## Shop and save

### Student discounts

Many shops offer discounts to students, so it's worth asking before you pay.

[Register for a TOTUM card](https://app.totum.com/register/join) and always take it shopping with you.

Student discounts and deals can be found on:

* [TOTUM](https://totum.com/)
* [Student Beans](https://www.studentbeans.com/uk)
* [Unidays](https://www.myunidays.com/GB/en-GB)

### Food shopping

* Make a meal plan for the week and use this to create your shopping list. This can help you avoid making impulse purchases.
* Sign up for [supermarket loyalty cards](https://www.savethestudent.org/shopping/a-guide-to-the-best-loyalty-cards.html) to get cheaper member prices.
* Buy in bulk and share essentials with your housemates.
* Try supermarket own-brand products for the best value.

### Clothes, books and more

* Buy secondhand university books from outlets such as Ebay, World of Books and Vinted.
* Shop for secondhand clothes, furniture and anything else you might need. Check charity shops, kilo sales, local Facebook groups, Facebook marketplace and Gumtree for the best prices.
* Arrange a clothes swap between friends or look out for clothes swap events in Bristol.
* Get your hair cut by a trainee at a [salon](https://www.reflectionstraining.co.uk/clients-and-models) or at the [local college](https://www.cityofbristol.ac.uk/centres/facilities/salons/).

## Travel for less

### Go green

Walk and cycle when you can to save money, keep fit and reduce your carbon footprint.

Learn about [hiring](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/transportplan/transport/cycling/#hire) or [buying a bike](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/transportplan/transport/cycling/#buying).

### Use public transport

#### Bus

Students living in the University's Stoke Bishop accommodation will [get a free U1/5/77 bus pass](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/building-services-and-facilities/cars-parking/#buspass) for the 2025/26 academic year.

Discounted student bus tickets are available on the [First Bus app](https://www.firstbus.co.uk/buy-tickets/ways-pay/students).

#### Train

Enjoy 1/3 off standard fares with a [National Rail 16-25 railcard](https://www.16-25railcard.co.uk/). This is also available to mature students of any age.

The best time to check for cheap trains is 12 weeks before you want to travel.

#### Coach

You can get [discounted Megabus coach travel](https://uk.megabus.com/nus-extra-card) with a TOTUM card.

You can also buy a [Young Person's Coach Card](https://www.nationalexpress.com/en/offers/coachcards/young-person) (available to full-time students of any age) for discount coach travel with National Express.

Booking your coach tickets in advance will save you money.

## Save money at home

### Keep energy bills down

* Do full loads of washing every time. This will save money on energy bills or at the launderette.
* [Wear extra layers of clothing](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/utilities/heat-the-human-not-the-home-save-energy/) instead of turning the heating on.
* Turn off lights when you leave a room and don’t leave laptops and mobiles on charge.
* Only boil as much water as you need in a kettle.

### Avoid food waste

* [Love Food Hate Waste](https://www.lovefoodhatewaste.com/) has resources to help you reduce food waste, including recipes and ideas for using leftovers. You can also find out which surprising foods can be frozen.
* Use apps like [Too Good to Go](https://www.toogoodtogo.com/en-gb) and [Imperfect Foods](https://www.imperfectfoods.com/?redirect=true&promo=IF240610X4) to find discounted surplus food from shops and restaurants. You can rescue food that otherwise would be wasted and get yourself a bargain.
* Cook extra dinner to give yourself leftovers for lunch the next day. The University has microwaves on campus you can use to heat food.
* Cook in batches and freeze in portions.
* Freeze food that's close to its use-by date to eat another day.
