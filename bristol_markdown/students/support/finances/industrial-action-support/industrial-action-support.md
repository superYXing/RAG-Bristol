> Financial support for students affected by the industrial action.

## Reimbursement fund

Students affected by the industrial action can claim for out-of-pocket expenditure incurred as a result of strikes.

This will include, but is not limited to, childcare or travel costs, for example bus and rail fares, on days when teaching or research activity was cancelled due to industrial action.

Students will not be able to claim for costs related to non-strike days, or for a refund of tuition fees.

For full details of financial support available, please refer to the [terms and conditions](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/industrial-action-support/terms/).

If you have read the terms and conditions and believe that you would be eligible for a payment, [complete the short online claim form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG3okPmcberBHt-iwi1k7fYJUNUZZRVhOM0VPN1E5VzRJMDRLVFIxRUY4WiQlQCN0PWcu). You will be asked to upload images of receipts to provide evidence of the expenditure.
