The Financial Assistance Fund supports students who may need to withdraw from their studies due to unexpected or unavoidable financial problems. It does not need to be repaid.

The fund is limited and cannot be used as a main source of income.

Awards are made at the discretion of the University.

## Eligibility

You can only apply for the fund if you are a fully registered University of Bristol student.

The fund is available to:

* undergraduates
* postgraduate taught/research
* home and EU/international fee-paying students.

You must also:

* be in financial difficulty that puts you at risk of withdrawing from university
* have access to less than £100 across all bank accounts (including savings)
* receive the government maintenance loan, unless exempt (UK students only).

You cannot apply if you are a:

* pre-sessional student
* visiting student
* exchange student.

Payments for part-time and temporarily withdrawn students are capped.

### Summer application eligibility

Applications are open between 26 May and 14 September 2025.

To apply, you must meet one or more of these conditions:

* have confirmed re-sit exams or are re-taking elements of your course during the summer term
* are taking a course with exams in July
* are a student in Health Sciences undertaking a placement during the summer term
* have caring responsibilities for a [child or adult dependent](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/advice/dependants/)
* have an illness which prevents you from working a part-time job
* were under 25 at the start of your course AND are:

+ a care leaver
+ estranged from both parents
+ or have no living parents.

#### Final year undergraduate students

Final year undergraduate students whose enrolment with the University is due to end in the summer are not eligible. If you are re-taking any assessments, including your dissertation, you may still be eligible.

#### Postgraduate taught students

Postgraduate taught students who are writing dissertations during the summer are eligible.

#### Postgraduate research students

Postgraduate research students are eligible.

## Types of assistance

You can either apply for a £50 food voucher or the standard cash award (where eligible).

### Food vouchers

If you apply for a food voucher, you must provide supporting documents that you have access to less than £100 across all bank accounts. You do not need to give any other information about your personal circumstances.

Applications for food vouchers are usually assessed within one working day. Vouchers are emailed to successful applicants.

You can make multiple applications for food vouchers, as long as you remain eligible. This is limited to three vouchers per application window. You cannot receive more than one voucher in a four-week period.

Food vouchers count towards your total award value for the current term. If you receive a £50 food voucher and later apply for the standard cash award, this value will be taken from your total award.

If you have already received a cash award during this term, you cannot receive a food voucher.

### Standard cash award

If you apply for the standard cash award, you will need to provide more information and supporting documents than for the food voucher.

There are three award levels available:

* Level 1: £250
* Level 2: £500
* Level 3: £750

If your application is successful, our assessors will decide which award you will receive based on:

* your provided information
* the eligibility criteria.

#### Level 1

Level 1 awards are available to applicants who declare that they are in financial difficulty and can prove access to less than £100 across all bank accounts (including savings). This is after income (from part-time work, scholarships, bursaries, or other sources) and reasonable expenses for the term.

#### Level 2

Level 2 awards are available to applicants who meet Level 1 criteria and are taking reasonable steps to reduce their financial problems but remain in difficulty. This can include:

* working a part-time job for a reasonable number of hours per week
* using a considerable amount of an interest-free student overdraft.

Alternatively, applicants may have:

* excessive debt
* placement-related costs
* a health problem preventing their ability to work a part-time job.

Home students must be in receipt of the UK government maintenance loan (unless exempt).

International Students must prove that they have made ‘reasonable financial provision’ before starting their course.

#### Level 3

Level 3 awards are only available to applicants who meet Level 2 criteria, are in full-time study, and satisfy at least one of the following:

* have [dependent children](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/advice/dependants/)
* have caring responsibilities
* are in receipt of the [Bristol Standalone Bursary](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/standalone-bursary/)
* are presently homeless.

## When to apply

* Term 1: 15 September 2025 to 18 January 2026
* Term 2: 19 January 2026 to 31 May 2026
* Summer: 1 June 2026 to 13 September 2026

Do not submit more than one application per term unless your circumstances have changed.
