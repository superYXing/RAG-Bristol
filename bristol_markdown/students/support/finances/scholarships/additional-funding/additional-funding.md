> Prospective UK undergraduate students can apply for a range of funding provided by donations from friends and alumni of the University of Bristol.

The application for additional funding is a process of using one application form to apply for several bursaries and scholarships. Read about the available bursaries and scholarships in the 'Further details' section of this page.

Payment schedules and amounts depend on the bursary or scholarship awarded to successful applicants.

Bursaries and scholarships are not guaranteed to run every year.

## Eligibility

To be eligible for additional funding, you must:

* be a prospective Home (UK) student
* be resident in the United Kingdom
* be eligible for the financial support available from the UK government (in the form of tuition fee and living costs loans from the Student Loans Company)
* have an offer (or be awaiting a decision) to start an undergraduate programme at the University of Bristol in 2026/27
* be in full-time study (part-time students are not eligible to apply)
* have a demonstrable financial need (this means having a household income beneath £50,000).

This funding is in addition to the main [University of Bristol Bursary](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/uob-bursary/), which students do not need to apply for.

If you repeat a year, your funding is withheld until you progress to the next course block.

## How to apply

Apply using [the Additional Funding online application form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVGyaZAIvbt81KrKBR725vQtBUQjUzN1VPTFk4T0FMR01HOEVEVzk4M00zRi4u).

## Deadline

The closing date for applications is 11.59 pm on Sunday 10 May 2026.

## Assessment process

You will find out whether your scholarship application was successful in early June 2026.

If you are successful, you will be automatically matched to an appropriate scheme and asked to accept the terms and conditions of that scheme.
