Go to an overview of the [Additional Funding application](/students/support/finances/scholarships/additional-funding/ "Additional%20Funding").

## Eligibility

To be eligible for additional funding, you must:

* be a prospective Home (UK) student
* be resident in the United Kingdom
* be eligible for the financial support available from the UK Government (in the form of the tuition fee and living costs loans from the Student Loans Company)
* have been made an offer (or be awaiting a decision) to start an undergraduate programme at the University of Bristol in 2026/27
* be in full-time study (part-time students are not eligible to apply)
* have a demonstrable financial need (this means having a household income beneath £50,000)

Prospective students who select the University of Bristol as their insurance choice through the UCAS process will not be eligible for the award.

Priority will be given to applicants:

* from a low-income household
* from areas of low participation in higher education
* who have attended an aspiring state school
* who are under 25 and have previously been in care
* who have a disability
* who will be over 21 years old at the start of the course.

To ensure fair distribution of the available funding, you will not usually be eligible to receive multiple additional bursaries or scholarships. In addition, if you are receiving funding from any of the following schemes, **you would not be eligible to receive additional funding**:

* [Sanctuary Scholarship](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/sanctuary-scholarship/)
* [Vice-Chancellor's Scholarship](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/vc-scholarship/)

You may apply for additional funding and one of the above schemes with the understanding that **you can only receive funding from one of these**.

There may be rare occasions where schemes are processed in parallel, meaning that a few students are offered multiple awards. On such occasions, it is your responsibility to inform the [Scholarships and Bursaries Team](mailto:scholarships-bursaries@bristol.ac.uk) to check for compatibility of multiple awards. The University will also run eligibility checks throughout the year to ensure a fair distribution of the awards.

On these rare occasions where you are offered multiple additional awards, you may be asked to choose which scheme you prefer to receive or the University may decide based on a number of factors (such as the size of the reserve list). On such occasions, there will not be the option to receive both awards. If there has been an overpayment of funding, these overpayments will be recovered for redistribution.

The University's decision will take into account the needs of the entire student body and as such, will be final with no appeal process.

Note: if you repeat a year, your funding is withheld until you progress to the next course block.

## Awards

There are a number of bursaries and scholarships available each year for first-year Home (UK) undergraduate students. Some of these schemes have specific criteria relating to the course of study while others are open to students from any discipline. Most awards are made in the form of a payment to the student, however, some schemes are fee waivers.

These are usually awarded to students from low-income backgrounds, as assessed by household income data provided by the Student Loans Company via its regional funding providers. Normally, recipients will also be eligible to receive the University of Bristol Bursary, which is why these schemes are known as *additional* funding.

The value of awards to successful candidates will vary depending on the scheme.

Payments are likely to be made in two instalments, one in November and one in February. Details of the payment dates will be provided after registration.

This application process includes these bursaries and scholarships. We will update these bursaries and scholarships for 2026/27:

* [Futures scholarship](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/futures-scholarship/)
* [Black Futures scholarship](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/black-futures-scholarship/)
* [Boeing Futures scholarship](/students/support/finances/scholarships/boeing-futures-scholarship/)
* [The GF scholarship](/students/support/finances/scholarships/gf-endowment-fund/)
* [The Geraldine Keefe Women in Engineering Futures scholarship](/students/support/finances/scholarships/geraldine-keefe/)
* [Cratchley scholarship in History](/students/support/finances/scholarships/cratchley-scholarship-in-history/)
* [Qube Research and Technology scholarship](/students/support/finances/scholarships/qube-scholarship-in-research-and-technology/)
* [Lady Ryder Medical scholarship](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/lady-ryder-medical-scholarships/)
* [Anne and Peggy Sleigh bursaries](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/anne-sleigh-bursary/)
* [The Nicholls Arts bursary](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/nicholls-arts-bursary/)

* [Christopher Frederick Edwards Bursary](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/christopher-frederick-edwards/)

This list will be revised on an annual basis and no scheme is guaranteed to run every year.

The University also operates a Financial Assistance Fund and several hardship funds. If you receive additional funding, you are eligible to apply for these hardship funds. However, the amount of additional funding you're receiving would be taken into account during the assessment process for any of these other discretionary awards.

## How to apply

The online application form will open in term one on the [additional funding page](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG3okPmcberBHt-iwi1k7fYJUMkNZQUVaMFpaTTdaQTg5NUoxRlI0Wlg3SCQlQCN0PWcu&wdLOR=c07070B38-5F07-48C7-A1B2-1E3E40BEB9F6).

All applications should be received by the published deadline. The online application form will close once the deadline passes. There is no appeals process and requests to submit late applications will not be considered.

## Assessment process

1. Applications will be assessed and matched to available schemes according to the best fit.
2. Students eligible for subject-specific schemes will be matched first.
3. All other applications will be matched to the remaining funds.
4. Information provided in the application and other information provided with your UCAS application will be used to determine which applicants display the most demonstrable need.
5. The University will make offers of an award to successful candidates.
6. Full details of the scheme being offered, including the terms and conditions, will be made available.
7. If you are offered an award, you will be asked to accept the relevant terms and conditions.
8. You will need to firmly accept your offer of a place to remain eligible for the award.
9. To ensure that all available funding is distributed, the University will select a number of students to be on a reserve list. Students on the reserve list may be contacted at a later date to be informed that they have been offered an award should funding become available. Being placed on the reserve list is not a guarantee of an award.

## Other criteria

To receive a payment, you should:

* be registered at the University, engaged with your studies, and have a good attendance record
* be eligible for and have applied for means-tested financial support in the form of the tuition fee and living costs loans from the Student Loans Company
* have provided your (and your parents' pr guardians') consent to the Student Loans Company, via their regional funding provider, to share your household income data with the University.
