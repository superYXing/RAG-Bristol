Go to an overview of the [Anne and Peggy Sleigh Bursaries](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/anne-sleigh-bursary/).

## Anne Sleigh

Anne Sleigh attended a state secondary school and chose to study Physics at Trinity College, Cambridge where she was awarded a first-class Honours degree and a PhD. She worked in government and industrial research laboratories but died of cancer while aged in her 30s. These bursaries are awarded in her memory to encourage female students from state schools to study physics.

## Peggy Sleigh

Peggy Sleigh graduated from Bristol with a zoology degree in 1954 and stayed on as a research assistant, gaining an MSc. She taught biology for a few years before becoming a mother to three children. Once her children entered full-time education she returned to a satisfying career in teaching until her retirement. Her family initiated these bursaries in biological sciences in her memory.
