Go to an overview of the [Eileen Drummond and Sheila Anderson Law Bursary](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/edsa/).

The Eileen Drummond and Sheila Anderson Fund is named after Sheila Anderson (LLB 1956), who left a gift to the University in her will, and Sheila's mother, Eileen Drummond. The awards offer support to law students in need of financial aid.

For Sheila Anderson, law, justice and access to education were more than just a passion, they were at the core of who she was. Her life-changing legacy donation to the University of Bristol equals more than £1.5 million.

Sheila graduated from Bristol in 1956, and went on to pursue a successful career in law, working both as a barrister and in-house lawyer throughout her life. This might not have been possible if Sheila had not been awarded a state scholarship from the government, which paid for her fees and living expenses at university. Receiving this support played an important part in Sheila pledging £1.5 million to create a permanent scholarship fund that will support law students at Bristol.

Sheila said: "I much enjoyed my time there. I wish to give others, who may otherwise be unable to afford it, the opportunity to study Law at the University."

Following her death in 2013, Sheila's gift has been used to establish a permanent scholarship fund for law students, and the first awards were presented to five first-year students in 2015.

Sheila was keen that this fund acknowledged her family name, hence the inclusion of her mother’s name Eileen Drummond.
