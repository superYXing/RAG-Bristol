### Award distribution

Applicants must meet the essential eligibility criteria to be considered for the scholarships.

To ensure fair distribution of the available funding, scholarships will be awarded using a scoring system based on the widening participation criteria.

When selecting the successful scholarship recipients, other awards students may hold from the University or external organisations will be considered.

The University’s decision will consider the needs of the entire student body and as such will be final with no appeal process.

## How to apply

The GF Endowment Fund is part of the additional funding programme. You can apply from the [Additional funding page.](/students/support/finances/scholarships/additional-funding/)

### Successful applicants

The University will make offers of a scholarship to successful candidates. Full details of the scheme being offered, including the terms and conditions, will be made available in the award notification.

Awardees will be expected to reply to the Scholarship offer notification, confirm their acceptance of the award and the relevant terms and conditions by email.

Awardees who do not reply within two weeks will have their scholarship offer rescinded (withdrawn) and the scholarship will be offered to someone on the scholarship reserve list.

### Reserve applicants

To make sure that all available funding is distributed, the University will select several students to be on a reserve list. Such applicants will be notified accordingly.

Students on the reserve list may be contacted later to be informed that they have been offered an award should funding become available.

Being placed on the reserve list is not a guarantee of an award.

## Assessment process

Applications will be accepted from students who meet all of the eligibility criteria and are currently undertaking the first year of the undergraduate course.

Information provided in the application will be used to determine which applicants display the most demonstrable need.

Priority will be given to applicants who fulfil the most widening participation criteria and are ranked most highly by the selection panel’s scoring mechanism.
