David Nicholls has established the Nicholls Arts Bursary to support gifted students of theatre and English to pursue their studies at the University of Bristol, regardless of their financial circumstances.

Born in 1966, David Nicholls studied Drama and English at the University of Bristol, before moving to New York, where he trained as an actor at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Returning to London, David worked as an actor for eight years, performing in many plays, including several years at the Royal National Theatre. After a period working as a TV script editor, he began to work full-time as a writer.

David is now a screenwriter for television and cinema and an internationally best-selling and critically acclaimed novelist. His novels include Starter for Ten, One Day and Us. His television work includes an adaptation of Tess of the D’Urbervilles, a modern dress Much Ado About Nothing, episodes of Cold Feet and the original drama The 7.39. In cinema, credits include Thomas Vinterberg’s Far From The Madding Crowd, Great Expectations, Blake Morrison’s And When Did You Last See Your Father and Sam Shepard’s play Simpatico. Forthcoming work includes a five-part adaptation of Edward St Aubyn’s Patrick Melrose novels.
