> This scholarship is part of the Futures Scholarships. They are for UK applicants, towards their first year of undergraduate study and employability opportunities.

Applications for the 2025/26 academic year have now closed.

The Cratchley Scholarships in History are funded from a generous legacy gift in the will of the late Margaret Parsons (BA History 1941, Cert Ed 1942).

Margaret, her sister Gladys, and her brother William studied at Bristol. They wanted to provide financial support to undergraduate students at the University studying history in memory of their parents Edwin and Alice Cratchley.

Up to four awards are available in 2025/26.

Successful candidates receive £2,000 for their first, second and third years. There is also a further £1,000 available as Career Employability funding.

Your awards have a value of £3,500 if you started before 2025/26. You receive:

* £2,000 in the first year
* £750 in the second and third years

There is also a further £1,000 available as Career Employability Funding.
