This information is only relevant for students who started in 2024/25.

For the 2025/2026 academic year, refer to the [Alumni discount page.](/students/support/finances/scholarships/alumni-discount/)

A 25% discount on tuition fees for your postgraduate degree will be applied for the full duration of the programme.

## Eligibility

The following criteria apply to applications for entry in September 2024.

The fee reduction will be applied if you:

* have previously graduated from the University of Bristol
* are progressing to a higher level qualification than you already hold.
* pay fees directly to the University and are wholly or partly self-funded. Receiving a Postgraduate Masters Loan from Student Finance still qualifies applicants as self-funded.

This discount is not available to students that have completed a pre-sessional programme only.

### Eligible programmes a student intends to study on:

* PhD
* MD
* EdD
* MSc

Find a [postgraduate programme](https://bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/search/).

Refer to our [frequently asked questions](#frequently-asked-questions) if you are unsure if either your intended or alumni programme is eligible.

## How to apply

You don't need to apply for this discount. If you are eligible, the discount will be applied automatically to your fees invoice.

Your alumni discount will be applied to the balance that you, as a student, must fund yourself after any other sponsorship or bursary is applied.

We cannot confirm if you are qualified for the discount before you register at the University. It will not be stated on your offer letter.

## Deadline

There is no application deadline. The discount will be applied automatically for eligible applicants.

## Further details

You may not see your discount in your financial statement straight away.

Your discount will need to be applied and processed. You will need to have completed the registration task before you can be assessed for eligibility. This can then take a few days. If the discount has not appeared after 14 days, or if you have any further questions, contact [education-administration-office@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:education-administration-office@bristol.ac.uk).

## Frequently asked questions

### Am I able to have confirmation that I’m eligible for the discount before I register at the university?

Currently, we cannot advise students on eligibility before their registration at the University. This page provides detailed guidance to assist you with your planning.

### Is my intended or alumni course eligible?

Here is a list of programmes that are not eligible:

* Postgraduate Certificate
* Postgraduate Diploma
* PGCE, Graduate Diploma
* EdD Hong Kong programme
* MPhil/MLitt/MMus (where applicants are enrolled on a stand alone)
* MPhil/MLitt/MMus and not aiming for direct progression to a full PhD award

The courses listed are not eligible as either intended course, or your alumni course. Review the scenarios for examples of how this concept is applied in practice.

### I am intending to study a Postgraduate Certificate, Diploma or a PGCE and have previously graduated with a Bachelor's degree from the University of Bristol. Am I eligible for the discount?

No, you would not be eligible for the discount on your programme. You would be eligible for the discount on any future course that does meet the requirement of progressing to a higher level of study, as well all registration and fee requirements. This page has details of these requirements.

This scenario also applies to all non-eligible programmes listed on this page.

### I am intending to study a Taught Master’s and have previously completed a Postgraduate Certificate, Diploma or PGCE. I haven’t studied at the University of Bristol before my Postgraduate Certificate, am I eligible for the discount on my MSc?

No, you would not be eligible for the discount on any course you intend to study in your current circumstances. Should you choose to study at the University of Bristol and complete your Taught Master’s, then you would be eligible for the discount on any future course that does meet the requirement of progressing to a higher level of study, as well as all registration and fee requirements. This page has details of these requirements.

This scenario also applies to all non-eligible programmes listed on this page.

### I graduated with my Bachelor's degree from the University of Bristol and have since completed a Postgraduate Certificate, Diploma or PGCE. I'm now looking at applying to a taught Master's degree. Am I eligible for the alumni discount?

Completing a Bachelor’s degree at the University of Bristol would mean that your Taught Master’s degree fees qualify for the discount, providing you meet all other criteria. This page has details of these requirements.

### I’ve completed a taught master’s at the University of Bristol and I’m going to study a PhD at the University of Bristol. Am I eligible for the alumni discount?

Completing a taught master’s degree at the University of Bristol would mean that your PhD degree fees qualify for the discount, providing you meet all other criteria. This page has details of these requirements.

### I’ve completed a Master’s by Research at the University of Bristol and I would like to go on to study a PhD at the University. Am I eligible for the alumni discount?

No, because you are not progressing to a higher-level qualification than you already hold. A Master’s by Research is a research programme and research to research is not classified as progression.

### I’m starting a PhD but I still need to complete my master’s dissertation in the first term. Am I eligible for the discount and will it be applied retrospectively?

We will require evidence that you have successfully completed your master’s at Bristol. Once this is obtained the discount will be applied. If you have already paid in full, you will receive a refund for the discounted amount.

### I’ve completed a PhD at the University of Bristol, and I would now like to study a master’s in another area at the university. Am I eligible for the alumni discount?

The Alumni Discount is only eligible for those progressing to a higher-level degree. Therefore, the discount would not be applicable in this case.

### I’m an Intercalating student. Would I be eligible for the discount?

You are not yet technically an Alumni as you have not yet graduated from your main programme of study. Therefore, you are not eligible.

### I graduated from UWE and studied the BEng Robotics undergraduate programme. Am I eligible?

You have not graduated from the University of Bristol and are therefore not eligible.

### When will I see the discount applied to my tuition fees in my financial statement?

You may not see your discount in your financial statement straight away. Your discount will need to be applied and processed. You will need to have fully registered for your course (not just registered online or provisionally registered) before the discount can be applied. This can then take a few days. If the discount has not appeared after 14 days, contact [education-administration-office@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:education-administration-office@bristol.ac.uk).

### Is the discount applied before or after sponsorship/bursary?

The discount will be applied to the self-funded balance that you as a student must pay after any sponsorship or bursary.

### I have two student numbers. What process should I follow to get the discount applied?

If you have two student numbers, contact [education-administration-office@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:education-administration-office@bristol.ac.uk) and provide all student numbers you have been assigned. We will then manually assess your eligibility and confirm whether the discount will be applied.
