> Scholarship, bursary and stipend payments are made directly to your UK bank account via BACS. Follow these instructions to submit your bank details so that we can pay you.

## Before you start

You will need the following information:

* Your bank account number (this is always eight digits).
* Your bank's sort code (this is six digits, sometimes separated by hyphens, eg 20-08-40).

## How to enter your bank details

1. Log in to your [Financial Statement](https://bristol.ac.uk/fees-and-funding).
2. Once logged in, select **My Bank Details**.
3. If you have not yet submitted your bank details, you will be given the option to do so here. In the **Review Bank Details** section, select **Create**.
4. Enter the account number, sort code and account name. Bank account name refers to the **name of the account holder**, not the name of your bank, for example MR J SMITH.
5. Select **Validate**, then select **Confirm**.
6. A confirmation screen will show you the details you have entered. If you are happy, select **Confirm.**

## Update your bank details

If you have previously entered your bank details but now need to amend them, you will need to make the change in your Financial Statement and [phone Student Services](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/help/) so that we can validate your identity. Your new bank details cannot be used until you have spoken to one of our advisers and we have processed the change.

Payments are processed up to seven days before the scheduled payment date. Do not make any changes to your bank details during this period. Doing so will cause the transaction to fail, which will cause a significant delay to your payment.
