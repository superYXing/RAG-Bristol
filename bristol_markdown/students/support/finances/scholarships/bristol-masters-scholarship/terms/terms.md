Go to an overview of the [Bristol Master's Scholarship](/students/support/finances/scholarships/bristol-masters-scholarship/).

## Eligibility

You must meet all the essential eligibility criteria in order to apply and receive a Bristol Master's Scholarship. To be eligible you must:

* have applied to study a master's programme (MA, MSc, LLM or MRes) at the University of Bristol, commencing in autumn 2026
* are eligible for home tuition fees
* have already achieved (or are predicted) a 2:1 undergraduate degree
* meet one or more of the [University’s widening participation criteria](/students/support/finances/scholarships/bristol-masters-scholarship/terms/)
* be an external applicant/non-University of Bristol graduate.

Before the scholarship is finalised you will need to have:

* an unconditional offer to study
* received a 2:1 or higher undergraduate degree
* met any other specific conditions.

Our alumni discount provides support for our University of Bristol graduates. The Bristol Master's Scholarships is in place to support external applicants.

You are not eligible if you are an applicant for:

* a PGCE, PG CERT, PG DIP and (MSc) (R) programme
* a Master’s degree as part of your intercalation year.

You must also be from a group that is underrepresented in Bristol's taught master's population. This means meeting one or more of the widening participation criteria, including:

* having refugee status issued by the UK Home Office
* having been previously eligible for free school meals
* being classed as a mature student when you started your first degree. For example, you were aged 21 or over on the first day of the course.
* have once been a care leaver (spent three months or more in local authority care). This can include:
  + with foster carers under local authority care
  + in a residential children's home
  + being 'looked after at home' under a supervision order
  + living with friends or relatives in kinship care.
* having completed an undergraduate University of Bristol Widening Participation scheme
* having a disability
* being from an ethnic minority background
* being a military veteran or child of a military family
* being bereaved of or estranged from both parents and under the age of 25. A student is defined as estranged from their parents if they have had:
  + no communication or functioning relationship with either parent, and
  + no physical or financial support from then for at least 12 months
* having caring responsibilities. We define a carer as anyone who has a commitment to providing unpaid care for a family member or friend who could not cope without their support. This may be due to illness, disability, a mental health issue or substance misuse.
* having dependent children. This is defined as those living with their parent(s) who are either aged under 16 or 16 to 18 years and in full-time education. (This excludes children aged 16 to 18 who have a spouse, partner or child living in their household).
* having been out of Higher Education for 3 years or more
* being the first in the family to go to Higher Education.

## Scholarships

Each successful Bristol Master's Scholarships awardee will receive £2,000, which is payable in two equal instalments:

* £1,000 (mid-October 2026)
* £1,000 (mid-January 2027)

Successful awardees undertaking either part-time study or a two-year full-time programme will only receive the scholarship in the first year of study.

Part-time students will receive the full amount of the scholarship (£2000) in their first year of study. Part-time students are ineligible to apply for any other year of study other than their first year.

## Award distribution

Applicants must meet the essential eligibility criteria to be considered for the scholarships.

To ensure fair distribution of the available funding, scholarships will be awarded using a scoring system based on the widening participation criteria.

When selecting the successful scholarship recipients, other awards students may hold will be considered.

You will not be eligible for a Bristol Master's Scholarship if you receive:

* Advance Scholarship from the University of Bristol Business School
* Alumni Discount
* Access Postgrad fee waivers
* University of Bristol Sanctuary Scholarship

If you receive any other award, your eligibility for the Bristol Master's Scholarship will be at our discretion. It may be dependent on the availability of funding.

The University's decision will consider the needs of the entire student body and as such, will be final with no appeal process.

## How to apply

If you have already applied to study a full-time master's programme (MA, MSc, LLM or MRes) at the University starting in autumn 2026, you can complete the [online application form](https://forms.office.com/e/b9nv5XjP5y) to apply for the Bristol Master's Scholarship.

## Deadline

The deadline is midday on 29 May 2026.

The online application form will close to all applicants once the deadline (midday 29 May 2026) has passed.

There is no appeal process and requests to submit late applications will not be considered.

## Assessment process

Applications will be accepted from students who meet the eligibility criteria and have applied to study a full-time postgraduate Master's programme.

Information provided in the application will be used to determine which applicants display the most demonstrable need.

Priority will be given to applicants who fulfil the most widening participation criteria and are ranked most highly by the selection panel's scoring mechanism.

## Timetable

After the application closing date, you will be told whether your scholarship application was successful on the week commencing 19 June 2026.

## Successful applicants

The University will make offers of a scholarship to successful candidates. Full details of the scheme being offered, including the terms and conditions, will be made available in the award notification.

All scholarship recipients must provide evidence of their 2:1 or first-class honours undergraduate degree and must meet all the terms and conditions of their academic offer.

Awardees must reply by email to the scholarship offer notification and confirm their acceptance of the award, and the relevant terms and conditions, by the date specified in the award letter.

Awardees who do not reply within two weeks will have their scholarship offer rescinded and the scholarship will be offered to one of the applicants on the scholarship reserve list.

## Reserve applicants

To ensure that all available funding is distributed, the University will select a number of students to be on a reserve list. Such applicants will be notified accordingly, after each selection round.

Students on the reserve list may be contacted at a later date to be informed that they have been offered an award should funding become available.

Being placed on the reserve list is not a guarantee of an award.

## Other criteria

To receive a payment, you must be fully registered (in-person) at the University and engaged with your studies.
