The University of Bristol is pleased to partner with The Unite Foundation to offer the Unite Foundation scholarship. The Unite Foundation supports estranged and care-experienced students with a rent-free #HomeAtUniversity for up to three years through a nationwide scholarship scheme.

## Eligibility

You can apply for the scholarship if you are:

* 25 or under
* a statutory care leaver, care experienced (Scotland), or estranged from your family
* starting or studying your first undergraduate degree
* eligible for UK home fee status
* applying to one of the Unite Foundation’s partner universities (this includes University of Bristol)

Current students who meet the eligibility criteria can also apply for the scholarship.

Visit the [Unite Foundation website](https://thisisusatuni.org/unite-foundation-scholarship/) for full details.

## How to apply

Applications open on 1 January 2025.

## Assessment process

The Unite Foundation cannot provide awards for every eligible young person.
