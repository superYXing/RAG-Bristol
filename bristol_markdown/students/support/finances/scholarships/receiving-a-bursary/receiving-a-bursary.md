## Home students: UG and PGT

All payments are made directly to your UK bank account via BACS.

You need to [confirm your details](#confirm) so that we can pay you.

## International and EU students: UG and PG

### University of Bristol scholarships

If you receive one of our international scholarships, for example Think Big, your scholarship will be applied to your tuition fees once you have completed registration.

Your reduced invoice for tuition fees will appear on your [financial statement](https://bristol.ac.uk/student-financial-statement?_gl=1*waygdq*_ga*Mzg4OTY1MzU3LjE2ODgxMTA4NDg.*_ga_6R8SPL3HLT*MTY5NDYxMTY3My45NC4xLjE2OTQ2MTc1MzUuNDMuMC4w). No cash alternative is available.

If the amount of scholarship awarded is more than the cost of your tuition fees, your fees will be paid in full but you will not receive the balance.

If your undergraduate scholarship covers more than one year of study, it will be applied to your tuition fees for each year you re-register.

### University of Bristol bursaries

If you receive one of our international bursaries, your bursary will be paid to you once you have registered in full at the University and [opened a UK bank account](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/new/new-international/after/open-a-bank-account/).

You then need to [confirm your details](#confirm) so that we can pay you.

## Confirm your details

All payments are made directly to your UK bank account via BACS.

Make sure that you have entered your bank details in your [financial statement](https://bristol.ac.uk/fees-and-funding) so that we can pay you. You can enter your bank details even before you have been notified that you are going to receive a payment by [following these instructions](/students/support/finances/scholarships/bank-details/).

If you have previously entered your bank details but now need to amend them, you will need to make the change in your [financial statement](https://bristol.ac.uk/fees-and-funding) and [phone Student Services](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/help#infopoint) so that we can validate your identity. Your new bank details cannot be used until you have spoken to one of our advisers and we have processed the change.

If you are a home undergraduate student and have applied for means-tested support for your living costs, you also need to ensure you have provided [consent to share your household income](/students/support/finances/scholarships/uob-bursary/faqs/).

If you receive an email from the Money Advice and Funding team requesting information or action from you, please respond or act promptly.

## Receiving your payment

We aim to generate payments for the majority of eligible students by the end of October.

If you have not heard from us by then, check your [financial statement](https://bristol.ac.uk/fees-and-funding). If you cannot see the payments you are expecting to receive, [get in touch with us](mailto:student-funding@bristol.ac.uk) after 31 October.
