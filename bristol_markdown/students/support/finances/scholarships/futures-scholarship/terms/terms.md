## Award

Awards to successful candidates will have a value of £7,000.

The award will be split into payments of £2,000 in the first, second and third years.

There is a further £1,000 available as Career Employability funding.

Awards will be paid via BACS in two equal instalments each year.

To receive a payment, you should be:

* registered
* engaged with your studies
* have a good attendance record

The University reserves the right to allocate any payments of the award to any outstanding invoices should a recipient have missed payments due to the University. This is in line with the University’s regulations.

#### If you started before 2025/26

Your awards have a value of £3,500 if you started before 2025/26. You receive:

* £2,000 in the first year
* £750 in the second and third years

There is also a further £1,000 available as Career Employability Funding.

### Career Employability funding

Recipients will have access to up to £1,000 of funding support for employability opportunities, such as an internship, placement, or summer research programme.

Recipients are responsible for identifying a suitable internship or other opportunity and explaining why it provides a meaningful experience that enhances their employability. They will have the support of the Futures Scholarships Co-ordinator and the Careers Service to explore the opportunities available. The employability opportunity will be agreed upon with the Futures Scholarships Co-ordinator who must approve the release of funding.

This funding support will be paid as most appropriate to the chosen opportunity and will not always be a direct payment to the student. To access the funding, recipients may need to provide evidence, such as receipts, for the Futures Scholarships Co-ordinator to approve.

See the [Employability Funding terms and conditions](/students/support/finances/scholarships/futures-scholarship/employability-terms/).

The employability funding is flexible and may be taken at different stages of study, depending on individual circumstances, including up to 12 months after graduation.

## Reporting and connecting with donors of the scholarship programme

### Reporting

This scholarship is funded by donations from alumni and friends of the University. Scholarship recipients of the Futures scholarship (Futures Scholars) must provide update reports throughout their degree to the donors of this programme. This will be coordinated through the Development and Alumni Relations Office (DARO).

Futures scholars must also engage with and provide updates to the Careers Service when using the [career employability funding](/students/support/finances/scholarships/futures-scholarship/employability-terms/).

Both DARO and the Careers Service will support Futures Scholars to complete these updates.

### Connecting with donors

Futures Scholars will also be invited to take part in activities organised by DARO to thank donors and encourage others to donate and support more students in the future.

Possible activities may include:

* providing thank you messages
* taking part in photo shoots
* featuring in paper and online publications
* attending donor events (either online or in person)
* opportunities to deliver presentations and speeches at donor events.

We strongly encourage Futures Scholars to get involved in these activities as many students find them an enjoyable way to meet other scholars, develop new skills and learn more about the University community.

## How to apply

Apply via the [additional funding form](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/additional-funding/).

All applications should be received by the published deadline. The online application form will close once the deadline has passed. There is no appeal process and requests to submit late applications will not be considered.

## Application process

1. The University will make offers of an award to successful candidates.
2. Prospective students who select the University of Bristol as their insurance choice through the UCAS process will not be eligible for the award.
3. To ensure that all the awards are made, the University will select students to be on a reserve list for the scholarship. Students who are on the reserve list may be informed at a later date that they have been offered the scholarship, should an award become available. Being placed on the reserve list is not a guarantee of an award.
