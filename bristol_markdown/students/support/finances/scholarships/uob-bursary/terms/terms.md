## Award

| Household income | Bursary entitlement (full-time students) |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| £10,000 or below | £2,500 |
| £10,001 to £20,000 | £2,000 |

Bursaries for eligible part-time students will be calculated based on the tuition fee you pay. For example, if your part-time fee is 30% of the full-time fee, your bursary will be 30% of the equivalent full-time bursary.

The University may review the value of the University of Bristol Bursary from time to time.

## How to apply

You do not need to submit an application form for the University of Bristol Bursary. You (and your sponsors) must give consent for the Student Loans Company to share your household income details with the University.

When applying for a government loan, you are automatically opted in to allowing them to share your household income information with the university.

The University will receive information about your household income from the Student Loans Company. We use this to assess your entitlement to a bursary and to make awards accordingly. We cannot accept household income information through any other means.

## Award process

1. During the autumn term, you will receive an email from the Money Advice and Funding's Scholarships and Bursaries team confirming your bursary entitlement, provided the Student Loans Company has supplied the necessary information. Not all recipients will be informed at the same time.
2. You are required to provide the University with your bank details to ensure timely bursary payments directly into your account using the BACS process. Follow these [instructions to enter your bank details](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/bank-details/).
3. All payments are made via BACS, therefore we will not be able to make payments to students until they have provided their bank details.
4. Payments will be made in three instalments.

## Other criteria

* You are required to inform Money Advice and Funding if there is a change to your household income that will affect your bursary entitlement.
  + In the case where the amount you are to receive moves from a higher to a lower band, the University will not normally reclaim any overpayment. Any outstanding payments during the remaining academic year will be adjusted to the new bursary level.
  + However, if you have already received more than the total value of the partial bursary from your previous instalments, no further payments will be made for that academic year.
* If you suspend or withdraw from your studies, you will not have to repay any bursary payment. If you are in attendance on the date that bursary payments are made, you will receive your bursary instalment. If you suspend or withdraw, you shall be invoiced for any payments received after your suspension or withdrawal date. Payments received before that date will not be reclaimed.
* If you repeat a year you will not automatically be entitled to repeat bursary funding.
