> The University of Bristol Bursary is paid to thousands of students every year.

The University of Bristol Bursary has changed for undergraduate students starting in 2025/26. If you started before then, see the [previous terms and conditions](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/uob-bursary/terms/2019/).

Awards of up to £2,500 are available for every year of your course.

This is not a loan: it is a grant from the University that does not have to be repaid. You will get direct payments into your bank account in three instalments on:

* 27 October
* 9 February
* 30 March.

You are also eligible for a discounted Active Plus sports pass.

You may also be interested in applying for [additional funding](/students/support/finances/scholarships/additional-funding/).

## Eligibility

You are eligible if you:

* are a Home UK undergraduate on a full-time or part-time programme;
* are eligible for and have applied for a means-tested government maintenance loan (with Student Finance having shared your household income details with us)
* have a household income of £50,000 or below

For full eligibility criteria, read the [terms and conditions](/students/support/finances/scholarships/uob-bursary/terms/).

## How to apply

You do not need to apply for this bursary. You must:

* apply for financial support from your regional funding provider, who will assess you for means-tested support
* provide consent to share your household income

The University receives your household income information from the Student Loans Company. We will email you with your bursary entitlement in the autumn term.

If you think you are eligible, and we have not contacted you by 31 October 2025, please email [scholarships-bursaries@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:scholarships-bursaries@bristol.ac.uk).

For further information, read our [frequently asked questions](/students/support/finances/scholarships/uob-bursary/faqs/).

## Deadline

You must have claimed your University of Bristol Bursary by the start of the summer vacation for each academic year.

## Assessment process

The University will assess your entitlement to a bursary based on your household income.
