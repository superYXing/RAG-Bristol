## Scholarships

The Lady Ryder Medical Scholarships will provide a living cost stipend of £7,500 per annum for five years of study, paid in termly instalments.

## How to apply

Lady Ryder is part of the Additional Funding programme. You can apply from the [Additional Funding page](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/additional-funding/).

## Reserve applicants

To ensure that all available funding is distributed, the University selects students to be on a reserve list. Such applicants will be notified accordingly.

Students on the reserve list may be informed at a later date that they have been offered an award, should funding become available.
