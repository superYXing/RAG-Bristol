## Award

The Sanctuary Scholarship is intended to ensure that scholars do not need to pay for their tuition upfront and have access to reasonable living costs for the duration of their studies.

Your level of Sanctuary Scholarship funding will be determined by how much UK government student financial support you are eligible to receive and whether you study full-time or part-time.

You are expected to apply for and receive all UK government student financial support that is available to you, usually in the form of a loan for tuition fees and living costs. Your eligibility for UK government financial support depends on many factors, such as the level of course you are applying to, your residency status and whether you have studied in higher education before.

Recipients of the Sanctuary Scholarship will receive an additional award from the University to ensure that you have adequate funds for living costs.

If you are not eligible for any UK government financial support, you will receive a scholarship to cover your tuition fees and provide you with sufficient support for living costs.

The Sanctuary Scholarship covers the full regular duration of your studies. It will be renewed each year provided that you continue to meet all the following conditions:

* continue to be registered on your course at the time of each payment;
* continue to have a right to reside in the UK;
* continue to have a right to study in the UK.

There is a finite budget used to fund the Sanctuary Scholarship Scheme. The University will do all it can to ensure that this budget is fully utilised to support the maximum number of eligible students.

## How to apply

1. Apply using:
   * [the application form for undergraduates](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVGxBAOnQDD3VOr3M-psb3PahUNjBKOE04V0hXQ0VQSkpXWjlNQzQyRldHNy4u&route=shorturl)
   * [the application form for postgraduates](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVGxBAOnQDD3VOr3M-psb3PahUMjZaM01TRDJWMzgxTlE4QTlBSFNEUFdCTC4u&route=shorturl)
2. The selection panel will review the information you have provided on your application form, in order to fully understand:  
   * Your eligibility for UK Government student funding.
   * Any barriers that you may have faced to access and complete higher education, which might include any:  
     + interruption to studies;
     + unsuccessful applications to higher education;
     + inability to apply due to migration.
   * Your prior qualifications and whether you already hold a recognised degree or have previously experienced higher education.
3. The scheme aims to make sure that our scholarship student body is diverse in terms of the protected characteristics contained in the Equality Act 2010. When two candidates are equally matched through our selection criteria, we will give priority to minorities.
4. These criteria will form part of a wider application process, and therefore the selection panel reserve the right to take academic and budgetary considerations into account when making a decision on who will receive this discretionary scholarship.
5. The decision of the selection panel is final and there is no appeals process.
6. You must confirm your acceptance of any scholarship you are awarded within 10 working days of being notified. Failure to reply within two weeks (10 working days) may result in your scholarship being awarded to a reserve applicant.
7. If you decline the offer of a Sanctuary Scholarship, the award will be offered to a reserve applicant.
8. You will only be entitled to Sanctuary Scholarship award payments once you are fully registered at the University of Bristol.
9. You must provide the account details of a UK bank account to ensure timely Sanctuary Scholarship award payments. Payments will not be made to non-UK (overseas) bank accounts.
10. You will be contacted with a schedule of scholarship payments.
11. Each scheduled payment will only be made to you as long as you remain registered and satisfactorily engaged with your chosen University course or programme.
12. Requests for payments in kind will not be considered.
13. The University reserves the right to offset any payments against invoices for tuition fees or University-administered accommodation charges.

If you and your family are in receipt of asylum support provided by the UK Home Office, the Sanctuary Scholarship living cost award is likely to disrupt your eligibility for these payments. It is your responsibility to seek independent advice from a refugee organisation on the impact that the scholarship may have on your family's access to financial support from the UK Home Office.

## Right to study

If you apply for the Sanctuary Scholarship, the University of Bristol will be required to conduct a right to study check with the UK Home Office.

If you do not have the right to study confirmed by the UK Home Office, you will not be permitted to start your programme of study. Any decision will be final and cannot be appealed.

If you are awarded a Sanctuary Scholarship and are subject to immigration control, your acceptance of the scholarship will give consent for the University of Bristol to conduct a right to study check at the start of each term. The University of Bristol will seek your consent for any additional check that is required.
