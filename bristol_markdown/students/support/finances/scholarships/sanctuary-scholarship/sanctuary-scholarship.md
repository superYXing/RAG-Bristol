> Funding for students from asylum-seeking and refugee communities. The scholarship is equivalent to a full tuition fee waiver and a full living cost stipend.

Applications for 2026/27 are open.

If you are awarded this scholarship, the actual amount will depend on your fee status and whether you are in receipt of any other funding. The Sanctuary Scholarship is intended to ensure that scholars will have available funds to cover tuition and have access to reasonable living costs for the duration of their studies. See the [full eligibility criteria](/students/support/finances/scholarships/sanctuary-scholarship/terms/) for further details.

Scholars also receive free Active Complete Sports Pass membership. [Find out about our memberships.](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/sport/memberships/)
