> Find out when you will be paid instalments of your bursary, stipend, or scholarship.

## How to check your upcoming payments

1. Log in to [your financial statement](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/fees-and-funding).
2. Select **View your financial statement.**
3. Here you will be able to check and view any upcoming payments that have been scheduled for the current academic year, such as postgraduate stipend payments.

Payments are processed up to seven days before the scheduled payment date. Do not make any changes to your bank details during this period. Doing so will cause the transaction to fail, which will cause a significant delay to your payment.
