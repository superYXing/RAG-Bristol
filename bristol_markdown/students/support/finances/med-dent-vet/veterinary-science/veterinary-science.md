## Studying veterinary science as your first undergraduate degree

You can apply for a government tuition fee loan in all years of the programme. You can also apply to the government for maintenance funding.

If you receive means-tested support, you are entitled to an additional allowance of a maintenance loan. This would apply for each year of your course that has extra weeks due to practice placements.

### Intercalation and first-degree students

If you intercalate into an undergraduate course, you are eligible for maintenance and tuition fee loans.

If you intercalate into a postgraduate master's course, you may be eligible for the PG masters loan. Ask your department to defer your postgraduate degree until the end of the Veterinary Science degree. This will mean that funding is not affected by the PG masters award.

Find out more about [intercalation funding](/students/support/finances/med-dent-vet/intercalation/).

## Studying veterinary science as your second undergraduate degree

Second-degree students are not entitled to a tuition fee loan from the government. You will be liable for all years' tuition fees yourself. You can apply to the government for a means-tested maintenance loan for living costs.

If you receive means-tested support, you are entitled to an additional allowance of maintenance loan. This would apply for each year of your course that has extra weeks due to practice placements.

If your initial Student Finance assessment suggests that there is no available funding, do not worry. When an assessor reviews your application, the £0.00 funding will change. They will then assess you for financial support based on your household income.

### Intercalation and second-degree students

If you intercalate into an undergraduate course, you are not eligible for maintenance or tuition fee loans

If you intercalate into a postgraduate master's course, you may be eligible for the PG masters loan. Ask your department to defer your PG degree until the end of the Veterinary Science degree. This will mean that funding is not affected by the PG masters award.
