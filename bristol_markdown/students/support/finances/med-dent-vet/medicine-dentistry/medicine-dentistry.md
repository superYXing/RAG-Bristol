## NHS funding

All home (UK) medicine and dentistry (BDS) students in their **fifth and further years of study**can apply for NHS funding.

The [NHS Business Services Authority's student website](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/nhs-bursary-students) explains how to apply.

### NHS Bursary: additional allowances

You could apply for extra [NHS Bursary allowances](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/nhs-bursary-students) in your NHS-funded years if you:

* have children or adult dependents
* have a disability
* incur travel and accommodation costs on a practice placement
* are on a course that runs for more than 30 weeks and three days in the academic year.

## Medicine or dentistry as your first undergraduate degree

### Tuition fees

#### First four years of study

You can apply for a tuition fee loan from Student Finance in your first four years of study.

#### Fifth and further years of study

You can [apply for the NHS to pay your tuition fees](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/nhs-bursary-students) in your fifth and further years of study.

### Living costs

#### First four years of study

You can apply to Student Finance for a maintenance loan during your first four years of study.

You'll have a longer academic year due to practice placements in:

* years three and four of medicine
* years two, three, and four of dentistry.

If you receive the means-tested part of the maintenance loan, you'll be entitled to additional loan to cover these extra weeks.

#### Fifth and further years of study

You can [apply for NHS Bursary funding](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/nhs-bursary-students) in your fifth and further years of study.

You can apply for:

* a non means-tested grant of £1,052
* a means-tested bursary, based on your household income.

You can also apply to Student Finance for a reduced-rate, non means-tested maintenance loan for living costs.

## Medicine or dentistry as your second undergraduate degree

### Tuition fees

#### First four years of study

You are not entitled to a tuition fee loan from the government if you are studying medicine or dentistry as your second undergraduate degree. You will be liable for the first four years of tuition fees for yourself.

#### Fifth and further years of study

You can apply for your tuition fees to be paid by the [NHS Business Services Authority](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/nhs-bursary-students) in your fifth and further years of study.

### Living costs

#### First four years of study

You can apply to Student Finance for a maintenance loan during your first four years of study.

You'll have a longer academic year due to practice placements in:

* years three and four of medicine
* years two, three, and four of dentistry.

If you receive the means-tested part of the maintenance loan, you'll be entitled to an additional loan to cover these extra weeks.

Your initial Student Finance assessment may suggest there is no available funding. Don't worry. When an assessor picks up your application, the £0.00 funding will change and you'll be assessed for financial support based on your household income.

#### Fifth and further years of study

You can apply for NHS Bursary funding in your fifth and further years of study.

You can apply for a:

* non means-tested grant of £1,052
* means-tested bursary, based on your household income.

You can also apply to Student Finance for a reduced-rate, non means-tested maintenance loan for living costs.

#### Students living in Wales

If you are studying medicine or dentistry as a second undergraduate degree and live in Wales, you are not eligible for maintenance grants for living costs from Student Finance Wales. However, you can apply for a maintenance loan in your first four years of study.
