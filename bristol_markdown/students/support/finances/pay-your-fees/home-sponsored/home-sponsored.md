> If an external organisation - such as the NHS, a government department, charity or company - will be paying your tuition fees, you must provide confirmation of your sponsorship.

A sponsor is **not** a family member or friend who has agreed to pay your tuition fees.

## NHS sponsored students: what you need to do

### Returning students

* The MedAdmin Team will confirm your eligibility for the upcoming academic year each Spring.

### New or returning NHS sponsored students

* Submit your NHS Notification of Award letter (NOA) to [external-sponsors@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:external-sponsors@bristol.ac.uk) at the start of each academic year.
* At the end of the current academic year the window for applying for NHS funding opens. You should then apply immediately. You must submit proof of your funding before the start of the next academic year.
* The NHS bursary team will email your NHS Notification of Award letter to you one week after approving your funding application. You must then submit it to [external-sponsors@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:external-sponsors@bristol.ac.uk).
* The external sponsorship team will then create your funding record. You will receive an email confirmation when this has happened.
* Once you have registered, we will invoice the NHS for your tuition fees.

## Other home sponsored students: what you need to do

* Ask your sponsoring organisation to submit a Purchase Order (PO) or Financial Guarantee Letter (FGL) to [external-sponsors@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:external-sponsors@bristol.ac.uk) at the start of eachacademic year.
* If you don't submit the PO/letter, you will be liable for the course/programme fees for that year.
* The external sponsorship team will then create your funding record. You will receive an email confirmation when this has happened.
* Once you have registered, we will invoice your sponsor for costs mentioned on the PO/FGL. If there are mistakes or corrections needed, it is your responsibility to get this corrected. You must then submit a new letter to [external-sponsors@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:external-sponsors@bristol.ac.uk) as soon as possible.

You will be considered liable for all fees until we receive official confirmation from your sponsor.

If your sponsoring organisation requires further information, ask them to email [external-sponsors@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:external-sponsors@bristol.ac.uk)

You must comply with any requests made by your sponsor.

## Information required from your sponsor

Your sponsor letter, Financial Guarantee letter or Purchase Order confirms your sponsor's commitment for funding.

This document must be addressed to University of Bristol on official headed paper from your sponsor’s organisation, and must include:

* your name
* your programme or course of study
* the name and contact details of your official financial sponsor
* the date the letter was issued
* the length of the sponsorship and which academic years it’s valid for
* either the amount of sponsorship and breakdown of what it is to be applied to, for example tuition fees and/or bench fees
* the Purchase Order or internal reference number

or must state that the sponsor will meet the full cost of tuition fees and any additional course/programme.

If no breakdown is provided, we will apply the full amount to tuition fees and any remaining to bench fees (if applicable). It is your responsibility to provide this breakdown from your sponsor.

It is your responsibility that your fees are paid by you and/or your sponsor. We will only continue to recognise an organisation as your sponsor if payments are made promptly. If your sponsor fails to pay, the debt may be transferred to you and could prevent further registration graduation.
