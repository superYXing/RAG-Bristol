> How to share your invoice with a parent or guardian so they can pay fees on your behalf.

## Making payments

You must make any student [payments through Flywire](https://www.flywire.com/), our only approved third-party partner. You can use a range of payment methods, such as card payment, bank transfer, and others. We cannot accept direct payments to our bank account for security reasons. Be aware of [scams and fake services](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/securityservices/student-fraud/#fake-messages).

Start every payment from [your financial statement](https://bristol.ac.uk/student-financial-statement) by selecting "Pay Now". This includes payments [made on your behalf](https://help.flywire.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013040453-Can-a-family-member-friend-or-third-party-pay-on-my-behalf), by a friend or family member.

You can contact Flywire for support by chat or telephone [through their website](https://help.flywire.com/hc/en-us/p/call-us).

To share your invoice and a personalised payment link with somebody else, such as a parent or guardian, so they can pay your fees, [go to your financial statement](https://bristol.ac.uk/student-financial-statement) and select 'Pay now'.

Once you have selected which invoice you want to pay, you will be taken to the Flywire portal. Our information will guide you through different screens. You will need to enter the information for the person making the payment before you can share the link. On the "Payment details" screen, select "Share your payment details" to share a payment link with a third party.

We can not discuss your payment with a third party, such as a parent or carer, without your permission.
