> Spread the cost of your tuition and accommodation fees and pay in instalments by direct debit.

## Making payments

You must make any student [payments through Flywire](https://www.flywire.com/), our only approved third-party partner. You can use a range of payment methods, such as card payment, bank transfer, and others. We cannot accept direct payments to our bank account for security reasons. Be aware of [scams and fake services](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/securityservices/student-fraud/#fake-messages).

Start every payment from [your financial statement](https://bristol.ac.uk/student-financial-statement) by selecting "Pay Now". This includes payments [made on your behalf](https://help.flywire.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013040453-Can-a-family-member-friend-or-third-party-pay-on-my-behalf), by a friend or family member.

You can contact Flywire for support by chat or telephone [through their website](https://help.flywire.com/hc/en-us/p/call-us).

## Direct debit deadline

Set up a direct debit instalment plan by:

* 10 September 2025 for your accommodation fees
* 13 October 2025 for your tuition fees

## How to pay in instalments

You can choose to pay your accommodation or tuition fees as a direct debit instalment plan. Direct debit uses your UK bank account details (not your card information) to take regular automatic payments by the relevant deadlines.

Find out [when to pay](/students/support/finances/pay-your-fees/when-to-pay/).

Choose 'Create a payment plan' in your [financial statement](https://bristol.ac.uk/student-financial-statement) and follow the instructions. You will receive a confirmation email once your plan has been set up.

If you are paying an instalment without a direct debit, you must pay this manually through your financial statement by the relevant deadline.

### Set up your direct debit each year

You must set up your direct debit instalment plan each academic year, even if you pay by the same method.

### Year abroad

You still need to set up a direct debit instalment plan in the same way for your tuition during your year abroad.
