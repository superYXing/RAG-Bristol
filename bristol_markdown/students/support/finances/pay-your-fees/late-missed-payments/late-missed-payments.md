> What to do if you think you are going to be late making a payment or if you have missed a payment date.

## Difficulty paying fees

You are expected to have money in place to either [pay your fees in full](/students/support/finances/pay-your-fees/pay-in-full/) or [through instalments](/students/support/finances/pay-your-fees/pay-in-instalments/).

If you need to discuss any difficulty paying outstanding fees, contact [finance-creditcontrol@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:finance-creditcontrol@bristol.ac.uk).

The Money Advice and Funding team can provide [advice on managing your finances](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/advice/).

## Missed payments

If you miss a payment deadline, your payment will be considered overdue. You will be contacted by the Credit Control team and asked to pay by another method.

The University reserves the right to terminate your studies or require you to leave your accommodation if you are unable to make payment after working with the Credit Control team. This is stated in your Student Agreement.

Any outstanding debt will be referred to a debt collector, and an additional administration fee will be added to the total owed and added to your account.

## Outstanding debt

You will not be permitted to register for your next year of study until you have cleared any outstanding tuition fee or bench fee debts.

If you have outstanding tuition or bench fee debts a month before the start of the start of your degree ceremony period, you will not be permitted to graduate.

We must tell the Home Office about international students with unpaid tuition fees. If you do not provide supporting documents to the Home Office of your ability to pay outstanding fees, your visa may not be extended.

You can find more information in the [Student Fees regulations](/secretary/student-rules-regs/).

## International students

* You must ensure you have [completed registration in full](/students/new/before-you-arrive/register/) to pay your fees.
* If there will be a delay in setting up a direct debit from a UK bank account, please notify [finance-creditcontrol@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:finance-creditcontrol@bristol.ac.uk), quoting your student number in the subject line.

### Sponsored students

If you are receiving funding from your home university, a scholarship or sponsor organisation and you think you are going to be late making a payment, or if you have missed a payment date, contact [finance-creditcontrol@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:finance-creditcontrol@bristol.ac.uk).

Find out how to provide your financial guarantee letter from the scholarship / sponsor organisation, with proof of funding if you are a [home sponsored student](/students/support/finances/pay-your-fees/home-sponsored/), or an [international sponsored student](/students/support/finances/pay-your-fees/sponsored/).

If you are an inbound Study Abroad student, contact the Centre for Study Abroad on [cfsa-inbound@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:cfsa-inbound@bristol.ac.uk) for further guidance.
