> You may need to pay a deposit towards your tuition fees, before arriving at Bristol.

## Existing students

After you have registered for the new academic year, you can pay your fees in [your financial statement](https://bristol.ac.uk/student-financial-statement).

## Who needs to pay a programme deposit

Programme deposits can apply to:

* international students
* postgraduate students
* pre-sessional English programme students
* international PGCE offer students.

You only need to make a deposit towards your tuition fees if you have received an offer letter, and an email about programme deposits.

## How to pay your programme deposit

You can pay the programme deposit in [your Applicant Portal](https://dyn.bristol.ac.uk/t/c/AQidiREQkItYGLnTrXMg3fKVEjP8lay0FJcjXseRLnrroE75BQGNdK40y6CxtBYLbOW8).

We will let you know how much you need to pay in your online offer letter.

We will send you a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) number once you have:

* met all the conditions in your offer
* confirmed your place at Bristol.

## When to pay your programme deposit

We will let you know when you need to pay your deposit by in your offer letter. If you pay your deposit by this deadline, the amount you paid will appear in your CAS.

If you are studying a pre-sessional English programme or are an international PGCE offer holder, you can [pay through Flywire](https://bristol.flywire.com/).

## Sponsored students

If you have a sponsor who will be paying your tuition fees, you do not need to pay a deposit. We will contact your sponsors with an invoice and ask them to pay the fee.

## Get support

International student programme deposits are non-transferable and non-refundable. There are some exceptional circumstances explained in the [International Deposit Refunds Policy](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/international/fees-finance/refunds/policy/).

If you have any questions about your admission, contact your [Faculty Office](/faculties/).
