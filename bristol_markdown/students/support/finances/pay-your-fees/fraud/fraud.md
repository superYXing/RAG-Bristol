## If you have been scammed

If you think you have been scammed, [report it to the UK Police](https://www.avonandsomerset.police.uk/contact/) as soon as possible. You can also [request wellbeing support](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/request-support/) and we will connect you to the right support or service.

## Phishing or fraud: getting fake messages or emails

Scammers may target you by sending you fake messages. This is called phishing. They might want to get money from you or trick you into sharing personal information, like:

* bank and card details
* account passwords

They may contact you by email, messaging services (like WhatsApp), social media, or telephone. These messages are often disguised as communications from us or other UK organisations such as:

* HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)
* Department of Education
* Student Loans Company
* Home Office
* UK Visas & Immigration (UKVI)

They use a variety of methods, including telling you that you or your family are under some form of criminal investigation. This could be a money-laundering investigation.

These messages and emails are common when you start university.

### Scammer pretending to be us

Scammers know when you are going to receive your next payment of grant or loan.

They might contact you or your sponsor claiming to be from our finance team or the Student Loan Company. If they ask you to transfer money via bank transfer or a link, it is most likely a scam.

We and the Student Loan Company will never ask you to transfer money through bank transfer. If you are not sure, call us on [+44 (0)117 456 9860](tel:+1174569860) to check the call's legitimacy.

## What to do if you receive suspicious emails or messages

* Never respond to emails that ask for your personal (and/or) financial details or your passwords.
* Check links before selecting them. Links and websites can be disguised to look like a site you trust but are fake.
  + Select the link to view the full address (URL) and check the web address matches one of the following:
    - www.bristol.ac.uk
    - [www.bris.ac.uk](http://www.bris.ac.uk)
* Do not open attachments in emails you receive which you were not expecting.

+ Check who the email is from: open the sender's contact card to check the email address or hover over the name or email address to view the full address.
+ If it does not match the name, or is inappropriate for the message sent, it is likely a scam.

* If the caller claims to be from a recognised UK organisation and they ask you for money or personal information, hang up and call back the number after 10 minutes.

**If you are not sure, do not reply and contact the [IT Service Desk](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/it-services/contacts/).**

## Money mule: receiving money for someone else

Someone may ask you to receive money into your bank account and transfer it into another account, keeping some of the cash for yourself. This would make [you a money mule](https://nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/moneymuling) (National Crime Agency).

Criminals try to ensure that the mule gets caught, instead of them. This is financial exploitation (abuse of money) for both, the mule and original victim.

Victims do not just lose their money, they can lose their family's savings, their businesses, their trust in other people, and it can impact their mental health.

### How to avoid being a money mule

Some suggestions from [National Crime Agency](https://nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/moneymuling) and [Nationwide bank](https://www.nationwide.co.uk/news-and-stories/how-to-avoid-becoming-a-money-mule/) are:

* If someone asks to “borrow” your bank account and they say it's “easy money” for you, be suspicious and ask why.
* Do not open a bank account in your name for someone else.
* If you are unsure, ask someone you trust for advice or call your bank.

Watch this short video on what criminals do to their money mule on [Crooks on Campus](https://crooksoncampus.co.uk/) (1 minute video).

## Tuition fee scams: offering to make payments for you

There are scams that offer to make tuition fee payments for you. They offer discounts or reduced exchange rates. This may include third party companies offering to process online international payments to send to us (University of Bristol).

However, we only have an official arrangement with Flywire.  Also, only we can offer discounts on tuition fees.

If you receive a message you are not sure about:

* contact the [IT Service Desk](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/it-services/contacts/)
* visit [Action Fraud's website](https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/)

### How to avoid tuition and accommodation fee scams

Our [pay your fees](/students/support/finances/pay-your-fees/) page explains how you can pay your fees. If another company (except us or Flywire) contacts you, do your research. Furthermore:

* do not share your username or password with any agent or third parties.
* you are the only person who should view your financial statement. No one else should have access.
* only we can offer discounts on tuition fees.

**If you have any doubts, do not continue with the transaction**. If you think you have been targeted, contact [Action Fraud](http://www.actionfraud.org.uk/report_fraud).

## Private accommodation scams

If you're looking for properties online, we suggest not sending money to anyone advertising properties until you know the advertiser and the accommodation are genuine.

Before you start looking, read our [advice on renting safely](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/accommodation/privately-rented/finding-private-accommodation/finding-properties-to-view/#rentingsafely)

## UK visa and immigration related scams

Scammers may ask for some money by claiming:

* you need to show proof that you have enough funds to support yourself in the UK.
* there is a serious problem with your immigration status and you need to pay a fine to them.

The official process needs you to show evidence, but it will never ask you for money.
