> When to make a payment and payment dates if you have set up a direct debit instalment plan.

## Making payments

You must make any student [payments through Flywire](https://www.flywire.com/), our only approved third-party partner. You can use a range of payment methods, such as card payment, bank transfer, and others. We cannot accept direct payments to our bank account for security reasons. Be aware of [scams and fake services](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/securityservices/student-fraud/#fake-messages).

Start every payment from [your financial statement](https://bristol.ac.uk/student-financial-statement) by selecting "Pay Now". This includes payments [made on your behalf](https://help.flywire.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013040453-Can-a-family-member-friend-or-third-party-pay-on-my-behalf), by a friend or family member.

You must pay your accommodation fees and tuition fees separately.

When you pay via your financial statement, you will be taken to our payment partner, Flywire, to complete your transaction.

## When to pay your accommodation fees
