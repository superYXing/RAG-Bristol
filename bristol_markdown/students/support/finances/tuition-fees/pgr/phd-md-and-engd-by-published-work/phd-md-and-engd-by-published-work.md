A PhD, MD, or EngD by published work allows you to apply for a research degree based on work you have already had published, as opposed to work undertaken as a student of the University.

You will need to pay registration and submission fees, but not tuition fees. Read more about the [criteria for candidature by published work](/academic-quality/pg/code-of-practice/information/degree-by-publication/).
