## EU student fees

### EU students who started between 2021/22 and 2025/26

EU nationals starting their studies from the academic year 2021/22 may be classified as home students or overseas students for tuition fee purposes. This will depend on individual circumstances and will be determined following an assessment of their [individual fee status](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/fee-status/).

If you are classified as a home student, check the [home student fees table](#home) to find out how much you need to pay this year. If you are classified as an overseas student, visit the [overseas undergraduate tuition fees](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/tuition-fees/ug/overseas/) pages.

### EU students who started in 2020/21 or earlier

EU students who started in 2020/21 or earlier will continue to pay the same fees as home students for the duration of their course.
