## Fee changes

You are charged the 'home' tuition fee plus a fee supplement. Your fee supplement is equal to the amount of funding the University gets from the Office for Students for UK students.

* Home fees may increase for subsequent years of your programme in line with UK Government policy.
* Supplements may also change for subsequent years of your programme in line with the latest Office for Students grant funding allocations published at the time the fee is agreed.
