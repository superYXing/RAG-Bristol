## Making payments

You must make any student [payments through Flywire](https://www.flywire.com/), our only approved third-party partner. You can use a range of payment methods, such as card payment, bank transfer, and others. We cannot accept direct payments to our bank account for security reasons. Be aware of [scams and fake services](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/securityservices/student-fraud/#fake-messages).

Start every payment from [your financial statement](https://bristol.ac.uk/student-financial-statement) by selecting "Pay Now". This includes payments [made on your behalf](https://help.flywire.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013040453-Can-a-family-member-friend-or-third-party-pay-on-my-behalf), by a friend or family member.
