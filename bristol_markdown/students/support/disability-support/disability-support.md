> Advice on how to get study support for a disability, including guidance on providing supporting documents, getting a diagnosis, and exploring funding options.

## Requesting alternative exam arrangements (AEAs)

The deadline for [consideration of AEAs](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/disability-support/study-support/guide-to-aeas/) for the TB-2 assessment period is 11:59 pm on Tuesday 3 March 2026. You must submit a [study support request](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/disability-support/tell-us/) by this deadline to guarantee consideration.

You can still request AEAs after this deadline. If you do, we cannot guarantee we can put them in place for the TB-2 assessment period.
