### Other disabilities and conditions

If you are unsure whether you are disabled, [contact Disability Services](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/disability-support/contacts) to discuss support options.

## How to get support

### Tell us about your disability

If you are disabled, [tell us about it](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/disability-support/tell-us/), so we can make recommendations for your teaching and assessment.

### Get a diagnosis

If you suspect that you have a disability, or one that is not listed, we encourage you to [get a diagnosis](/students/support/disability-support/tell-us/diagnosis/).

## Temporary injuries, illness and pregnancy

Students experiencing temporary injuries, illness, and pregnancy are not disabled. This includes injuries such as a broken arm or leg, or illnesses such as viral infections. You can:

* contact a doctor for advice and treatment
* [contact your school](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/help/) as soon as possible to discuss any impact on your studies
* consider applying for [exceptional circumstances](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/exceptional-circumstances/)
* contact the student funding team if you are in [financial hardship](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/emergency-funds/)
* [request wellbeing support](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/).

A temporary condition could leave you with a lasting, non-trivial impairment affecting you in your day-to-day life and study. If this happens, [contact Disability Services](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/disability-support/contacts/) to discuss your options.

If you already have supporting documents confirming that your temporary condition has become a long-term disability, [request a study support plan](https://enquiry.bristol.ac.uk/SignIn?ReturnUrl=%2Fall-ssr%2F%3F_ga%3D2.148054718.842198740.1665391746-738779970.1658403011&_ga=2.10241266.650511804.1666080311-157785235.1666080311).
