> Funding options available to you for your everyday living, personal or medical care.

If you need funding for everyday living, personal or medical care, speak to your current funder about transferring your support when you come to Bristol. We (the University and our Disability services) cannot pay these costs.

If you are not currently receiving funding but might need this support here, [contact your local Social Services for advice](https://www.gov.uk/apply-needs-assessment-social-services).

If you are a UK home student, you can also consider applying for [Personal Independence Payment (PIP)](https://www.gov.uk/pip). PIP can help with extra living costs if you have both:

* a long-term physical or mental health condition or disability
* difficulty doing certain everyday tasks or getting around because of your condition.
