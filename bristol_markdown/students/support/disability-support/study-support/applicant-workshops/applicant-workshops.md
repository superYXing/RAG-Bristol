> Sign up to one of our workshops for information about study support for disabled students.

The University of Bristol supports all [students who identify as disabled](/students/support/disability-support/), including those with:

* specific learning differences
* mental health conditions
* physical or sensory impairments.

For applicants with disabilities starting in 2025/26, we will be running two different workshops.

## Workshops

### Workshop: Applying for the Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA)

* 1 July 2025, 1 pm to 2 pm. Online.
* 5 August 2025, 1 pm to 2 pm. Online.
* 2 September 2025, 1 pm to 2 pm. Online.

[Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA)](/students/support/disability-support/funding/dsas/) are available for UK home students. You should apply for DSA before you arrive at University. This will increase the chances of your support being in place at the start of the academic year.

This workshop will:

* give you advice on how to apply for DSA
* give you advice on DSA medical evidence requirements
* give you information about the types of support you might receive through DSA
* give you advice on how to access your DSA support once it’s in place.
