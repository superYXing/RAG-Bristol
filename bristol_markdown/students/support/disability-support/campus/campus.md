> Find out how we make our campus more accessible with adapted accommodation, disabled parking, and alternative ways to get into university buildings.

## Accommodation access

If you are a prospective student with mobility difficulties or sensory impairments, [take a look at our adapted accommodation options.](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/accommodation/about/room-types/adapted-and-accessible-rooms/)

If you are a visitor with any accessibility requirements, email our Residence Facilities Management team ([dg-rfmteam@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:dg-rfmteam@bristol.ac.uk)). They can provide further information about access to University accommodation and car parking.

## Disabled parking

Students can [apply for a disabled parking space and permit](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/transportplan/car-parking/precinct/disabled-staff-and-student-parking/). You will be given your own parking bay.

### Visiting the main university campus

If you are visiting a member of staff, [contact the person you are visiting](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/contacting-people/) and ask them to organise parking for you.

#### Blue Badge holders

Blue Badge Scheme holders cannot use disabled bays in university car parks as these are already allocated. Blue Badge holders can:

* Park on any single or double yellow lines for up to three hours
* Use any ‘pay and display’ parking for free all day, when displaying their badge.

### Visiting a residence

You can park in the disabled parking spaces using your Blue Badge. You do not need an extra visitor permit. Find out more about [visitor parking at our residences.](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/accommodation/parking/visitor-parking/)

### Visiting Disability Services

We have two disabled parking spaces available for visitors with mobility difficulties. [Contact us to reserve a space for your visit](/students/support/disability-support/contacts/). There is no fee for this service.

## Buildings

### Access

The University includes many protected historical buildings which we may not be allowed to change. [Check our AccessAble guides for access around University buildings](https://www.accessable.co.uk/organisations/university-of-bristol).

If you need more details about a specific building, including getting around inside the building, [contact your School Disability Coordinator](/students/support/disability-support/contacts/school-disability-coordinator/).

### Book a room

If you would like a private area to study, you can [book a room on campus](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/library/use/study-seat-booking/ "Bin").

You can use the ['find a room' service](https://www.bris.ac.uk/where-is-my/find/free-room/table) to book a room for a meeting with your support worker or diagnostic assessor. This service displays a list of spaces by building and their current booking spaces over the next three hours.

### Sensory rooms

Two sensory rooms are available on campus. One on the fourth floor of Senate House and one on the third floor of the Richmond Building, for students with neurodiverse conditions. The room includes sensory objects and calming decor. To book the space, email [bristolsu-spaces@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:bristolsu-spaces@bristol.ac.uk "mailto:bristolsu-spaces@bristol.ac.uk").
