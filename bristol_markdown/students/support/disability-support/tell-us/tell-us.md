> If you have a disability, health or mental health condition, or specific learning difference, tell us so we can help support you in your studies.

## Applicants

If you have disclosed a disability on your application, we will email you a personalised link to request a study support plan. We encourage you to tell us about your disability as early as possible so that we can prepare to support you. Information is not transferred to us from your school or college.

The University will consider your application using the same criteria as all applicants. Disclosing your disability will not affect your chances of receiving an offer.

You also need to state [any accommodation needs](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/accommodation/apply/your-accommodation-needs/) in your accommodation application.

## Current students

You can tell us about a disability at any point after you have registered. To tell us, complete the below form to request support with your studies. If appropriate, a [study support plan](/students/support/disability-support/study-support-plan/) may be offered.

[Request study support](https://enquiry.bristol.ac.uk/SignIn?returnUrl=/all-ssr/)

You will be asked a series of questions to gather information about your condition(s). This might include how they impact your studies and any previous learning support you may have had (for example, in school).

You may need to upload [supporting documents](/students/support/disability-support/tell-us/supporting-documents/) as part of the request. If supporting documents are not available immediately, you can log back into your request later to upload it, or email your supporting documents to us.

If a plan is recommended, you can choose whether you want your condition(s) to be named on your plan. If you answer **No**, you will still receive a plan and the support it recommends.

If you want to talk with someone and get advice before you request study support, you can [contact Disability Services](/students/support/disability-support/contacts/).

We strongly recommend that you request study support to ensure you get the right help for your studies. You can read about the [types of adjustments to your teaching and assessment](/students/support/disability-support/study-support/) that we may recommend.

### Next steps

Your request will be reviewed by an adviser, and they will make recommendations based on:

* supporting documents you provide of a disability
* what support has worked well for you in the past (your normal way of working)
* your course requirements.

You may also be invited to an appointment with a Disability Adviser to discuss your study needs in more detail.

For help during your studies, contact your [School Disability Coordinator (SDC)](/students/support/disability-support/contacts/school-disability-coordinator/).
