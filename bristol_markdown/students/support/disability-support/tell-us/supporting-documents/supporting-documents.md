## Supporting documents for Disabled Students’ Allowances (for UK home students only)

You will need supporting documents to apply for [Disabled Students' Allowances (DSAs)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/disability-support/funding/dsas/). The documents must show that your condition meets the definition of disability under the [Equality Act 2010](https://www.gov.uk/definition-of-disability-under-equality-act-2010).

Your condition must have a sizable and long-term effect on your day-to-day life or studies. Long-term means lasting, or likely to last, 12 months or more.

There will be different kinds of supporting documents needed for different conditions. You should only submit copies of documents not the originals.

## Physical or sensory impairments, mental health conditions, or other long-term health conditions

A letter or statement from a GP or other health professional, confirming the diagnosis and impact of a disability or condition

or

a [DSA evidence form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disabled-students-allowance-evidence-form), completed by a GP or [other health professional](#ohp).

## Specific learning difference (SpLD) such as dyslexia or dyspraxia

A diagnostic assessment report from a psychologist, educational psychologist, or specialist teacher with SpLD assessment practicing certificate.

## Neurodivergent conditions such as Autism or ADHD

a diagnostic assessment report from a clinical or educational psychologist

or

a letter or statement from a GP or other health professional, confirming a named condition has long-term day-to-day impact

or

a [DSA evidence form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disabled-students-allowance-evidence-form), completed by a GP or [other health professional](#ohp).

You can show your GP or other health professional our [guidance on providing supporting documents (Office document, 65kB)](/media-library/sites/students/documents/guidance-for-gps-on-supporting-documents.docx). This can help make sure they give the information needed for the DSA application.

Be aware that the DSA application process may use the term ‘medical evidence’ rather than ‘supporting documents’.

## If you are unsure if you have the right supporting documents

We can offer advice if:

* you are unsure whether your supporting documents are acceptable
* your DSA application has not accepted your supporting documents.

E-mail [disability-services@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:disability-services@bristol.ac.uk) copies of your supporting documents and explain what you need help with.

## If you do not have acceptable documents

If you do not have supporting documents because you haven't had a formal diagnosis, our ‘[Getting a diagnosis’ page](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/disability-support/diagnosis/) has advice.

You should still submit a [study support request](https://enquiry.bristol.ac.uk/SignIn?ReturnUrl=%2Fall-ssr%2F%3F_ga%3D2.148054718.842198740.1665391746-738779970.1658403011). There are some adjustments that we can arrange from self-declaration without supporting documents.

## Supporting documents in a language other than English

Documents in a language other than English must include a translation into English. If possible, this should be from a certified translator.
