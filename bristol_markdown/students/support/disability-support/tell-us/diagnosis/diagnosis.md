> If you think that you may have a disability, learning difference, or a mental health condition, we encourage you to get a diagnosis.

* [Get advice](#advice)
* [Specific learning differences](#spld)
* [ADHD or ADD](#adhd)
* [Autism](#autism)
* [Mental health conditions](#mental-health)

To request a [study support plan](/students/support/disability-support/tell-us/ "Tell%20us%20about%20your%20disability"), you will need to provide [supporting documents](/students/support/disability-support/tell-us/supporting-documents/). In most cases this will be a diagnosis from a doctor.

If you are referred for an assessment:

* there can be a long wait for an NHS assessment
* ask your doctor to write you a note that says why you have been referred for assessment and what sorts of things you struggle with
* we can use your doctor's note to put interim support in place while you wait for a formal assessment.

## If you are not sure if you have a disability, get advice

### Speak to a doctor

Contact a doctor to talk about why you think you may have a disability. You must be a registered patient to make an appointment. The doctor may agree to refer you for an assessment on the NHS.

### Contact the University Disability team

If you are unsure if you have a disability and are unable to speak to a doctor, [contact a member of the Disability team](/students/support/disability-support/contacts/). The university cannot offer you a diagnosis, but they can give advice.

### Specific learning difference assessment (SpLD)

A specific learning difference refers to a difference with particular aspects of learning. The most common SpLDs include:

* dyslexia
* dyspraxia
* dyscalculia and dysgraphia.

[Common characteristics of SpLDs](https://www.dyslexia.uk.net/children/what-are-specific-learning-difficulties/)

You can attend our ['Do I Have a Specific Learning Difference?' workshop](/students/support/disability-support/study-support/workshops/).

#### Formal assessments

If you suspect you have a SpLD, you will need a formal assessment.

You can find an assessor by:

* conducting a [PATOSS search](https://www.patoss-dyslexia.org/Tutor-Index-Landing)
* using the [British Psychological Society](https://portal.bps.org.uk/Psychologist-Search/Directory-of-Chartered-Psychologists) (BPS) list of chartered psychologists
* or, if you are in Bristol, you can choose from the [SpLD assessors list (Office document, 62kB)](/media-library/sites/students/documents/SpLD_assessors_list.docx).‌

Cost of SpLD assessments:

* Assessments may cost between £390 and £515.
* You must pay the cost of the assessment yourself.
* If your family income is less than £42,875 we may be able to provide you with [financial help](/students/support/disability-support/funding/assessments/ "Funding%20for%20SpLD%20and%20ADHD%20assessments").

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD or ADD)

Contact the [Students' Health Service](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students-health/) or your own doctor (you must be a registered patient) to discuss why you think you may have ADHD or ADD.

### Diagnosis for autism

Contact the [Students' Health Service](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students-health/) or your own doctor (you must be a registered patient) to discuss why you think you may have autism. Your doctor may agree to refer you for assessment on the NHS.

[National Autistic Society](http://www.autism.org.uk/) has advice about the [benefits of getting a diagnosis](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/diagnosis/before-diagnosis/deciding-whether-to-seek-an-autism-assessment) and how to discuss autism with your doctor.

### Diagnosis for a mental health condition

Contact the [Students' Health Service](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students-health/) or your own doctor (you must be a registered patient) to discuss why you think you may have a mental health condition. Your doctor may agree to refer you for an assessment on the NHS. The Students' Health Service has a specialist mental health nurse who you can request to see when booking an appointment.

Our [Wellbeing Service](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/) can offer you support without a mental health assessment. We recommend you get an assessment from a doctor or mental health nurse. Having supporting documents for your condition will let us provide you with a [study support plan](/students/support/disability-support/study-support-plan/ "Your%20study%20support%20plan").
