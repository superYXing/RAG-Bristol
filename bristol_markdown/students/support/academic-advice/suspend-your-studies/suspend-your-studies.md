> You may find that, for various reasons, you need to take a break from your studies. A suspension of studies is an agreement between you and the University, allowing you to pause your studies for a certain amount of time.

The process for requesting a suspension is the same for all students. The guidance on this page is mainly aimed at undergraduate and postgraduate taught students. Postgraduate research students can find guidance on the [PGR absences webpage](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/your-studies/postgraduate-research/absences/ "https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/your-studies/postgraduate-research/absences/").

## When you can request a suspension

You can request to suspend your studies for one of the following reasons (this is not a complete list):

* You are unable to study properly due to personal circumstances, such as:
  + medical reasons or disability
  + bereavement (loss of a loved one)
  + being a carer for someone
  + financial difficulties
  + required military service
  + a change in your work schedule if you are employed part-time.
* You can show that taking a break will benefit your academic progress.   
  This could include:
  + accepting a job or pursuing other activities that will help with your academic development
  + transferring to a different programme.

## Get advice

We recommend you talk with your [personal tutor](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/personal-tutors/) or [student support team](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/help/#school) before submitting a request. There may be other options available to you other than suspension. They can discuss your options and help you make an informed decision.

Support is also available through:

* [Wellbeing services](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/request-support/): wellbeing and mental health support for all students
* [Bristol Students’ Union (SU) Academic Advice service](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/support-centre/academic-advice): guidance for making difficult academic decisions
* [Student finances](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/advice/): help with money management and financial hardship support.

## How suspending can affect your studies

On your return from suspension, you will normally join the next year’s cohort, with all teaching and assessment alongside that group. We cannot guarantee the same units from the previous year will be available, as they may no longer run. Additionally, unit content, assessment, and delivery may have changed.

### Placements

If you suspend your studies before or during a placement (i.e. in industry or studying abroad), we will try to allocate you a placement with the next cohort, but this cannot be guaranteed.

## How suspending can affect your finances

Your suspension may affect your funding and any tuition fees that you owe.

Find out how to apply for further funding from Student Finance if [compelling personal reasons](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/advice/compelling-personal-reasons/) (CPR) have impacted your studies.

For full details about what happens financially when you suspend or withdraw, [visit the Money Advice web pages](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/advice/suspending/).

## How suspending can affect your accommodation

### University accommodation

If you suspend your studies, you will need to move out of university accommodation, as you will no longer be classified as a student.

You can inform your student accommodation by completing the intention to leave form via the [Accommodation Portal](https://bristol.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortalX/3B88D738/8/9/Login-Login). The last date you will be liable for rent will depend on the [reason you are suspending](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/rent-contracts-regulations/cancel-your-tenancy/#leave:~:text=The%20last%20date,these%20two%20weeks.).

Upon returning to your studies, you will need to apply for [returner accommodation](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/apply-to-stay-in-university-accommodation/returner-accommodation/).

For full details on your rent responsibilities after suspending your studies, [visit the Accommodation web pages](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/rent-contracts-regulations/cancel-your-tenancy/).  [Contact the Accommodation Services Team](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/accommodation/contact/) if you have any questions.

### Private-rented accommodation

If you suspend your studies whilst living in private-rented accommodation, this will impact the [council tax for your household](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/accommodation/privately-rented/finding-private-accommodation/private-renting-costs/#counciltax).

Read the [tenancies and terms guidance](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/accommodation/privately-rented/finding-private-accommodation/tenancies-and-terms/) including leaving a fixed term tenancy early for further information.

## How suspending can affect your visa

If you hold a Student visa, read the guidance on [how your suspension may affect your visa](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/student-visa/course/suspension/) and [contact Student Visa services](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/contacts/) for further support.

## How to request a suspension

### 1. Complete and submit request form

1. Submit a [suspension request](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/request-change-of-circumstances) with appropriate [supporting documents](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/supporting-documents/).
2. You will receive an email to confirm your suspension request submission.

You cannot backdate the suspension start date by more than one month.

Students requesting a suspension of more than 12 months need additional approval, which is only given in exceptional circumstances.

### 2. Receive outcome

You will receive an email about the outcome of your request. This usually takes around two weeks.

Until you receive this written confirmation, you are still a registered student and remain liable for [tuition fees](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/tuition-fees/).

Your suspension start date and last date of attendance will be recorded once approved.

## During your suspension

During a suspension of studies, you are not required or permitted to engage with your studies.

You will still have access to your University IT account, including email and OneDrive, but you will not receive course-related emails.

You will remain a member of the Students’ Union (SU), allowing you to use services like the [SU Academic Advice team](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/support-centre/academic-advice) and participate in student groups.

Depending on your situation, you may continue to access University services, such as [libraries](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/library/) and the [Wellbeing service](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/request-support/).  We recommend contacting these services directly to discuss your options.

## Returning to your studies

Before your suspension ends, we will contact you via your personal and university emails to discuss your return and any needed support.

You will need to:

* keep your contact details updated on [StudentInfo](https://www.bris.ac.uk/studentinfo/?_gl=1*196glq7*_ga*OTI0NDQ5NDQ0LjE3MjUzNDk0MzE.*_ga_6R8SPL3HLT*MTcyODk5NDYyOC44OC4xLjE3Mjg5OTUyNjAuMjQuMC4w).
* provide supporting documents for your fitness to return to study if you suspended your studies due to medical reasons.
* If you are not returning within the same academic year of your suspension, you will need to [complete registration as a returning student](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/returning/).

[See our guidance for returning students](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/returning/) for more information.

### International students

At least 4 months prior to your date of return, you must [email the International Student Visa Advisers](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/contacts/) to see if you need to apply for a new Confirmation of Accepted Studies (CAS).

Read our full guidance on [what international students need to do to return to study after suspension](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/tier-4/course/suspension/#returning-after-suspension).
