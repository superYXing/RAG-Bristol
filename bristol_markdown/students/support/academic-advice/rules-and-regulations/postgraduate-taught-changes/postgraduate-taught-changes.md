> We are making changes to our taught postgraduate programmes from the 2024/25 academic year.

The changes apply to:

* master's degrees
* postgraduate diplomas
* postgraduate certificates.

These changes are for:

* greater certainty
* an earlier start to the dissertation
* a more consistent student experience across the institution.

## What is changing

### Changes for master's degrees

* You will no longer need to achieve 120 credit points to progress from taught units to the research stage.
* Some master's degree programmes may have accreditation or health and safety requirements.
  + These may require you to pass a single specified taught unit before you can start the research unit.
  + Requirements are set out in the 2024/25 specifications within [the programme catalogue](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/AboutProgrammes.jsa?ayrCode=23%2F24#faculty).
* If you do not pass your taught units (apart from required units), you will still be able to progress to the research unit, but for a lower award.

### Changes for all postgraduate taught

* You will be allowed two attempts to ‘pass’ a taught unit in PGT programmes.
* If you do not pass your taught units (excluding specific units), you will still be able to continue with your programme, but for a lower award.

### Changes to classification method

Classification will be based on the total programme mark. This is calculated as the weighted average of all marks achieved in the programme:

* Distinction: final mark of 70 and over
* Merit: final mark of 60 to 69
* Pass: final mark of 50 to 59
* Fail: final mark of 49 or less

## Who these changes will apply to

The changes will apply to you if:

* you are a new entrant onto a PGT programme from the 2024/25 academic year.
* you are an existing student who first registered on a PGT programme before 2024/25.

### Existing students

We will check to make sure you are not disadvantaged by the change in the classification method. For example, if you would have been awarded a higher classification under the 2023/24 regulations, your classification will be raised .

## Non-standard programmes

There are a small number of PGT programmes that are non-standard. These may have a different approach within their [own specific regulations (pdf).](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/academic-quality/documents/taught-code/annexes/regulations-for-specific-programmes.pdf)

* MA Law
* MSc Social Work
* MRes Economics
* programmes in Clinical Neuropsychology
* postgraduate certificate in Education
* MSc in Veterinary Sciences / postgraduate diploma in Veterinary Clinical Practice
* postgraduate diploma in Orthodontic Therapy

The 2024/25 version of regulations for these programmes that sets out arrangements for progression, award and classification will be published in August 2024. This will be available on our [on our website](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/assessment/). In the meantime contact the relevant school for more information.
