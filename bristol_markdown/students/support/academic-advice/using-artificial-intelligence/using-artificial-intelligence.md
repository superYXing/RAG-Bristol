> How to know whether you can use AI for studying or assessment, to what extent and what to do if you are not sure.

The use of AI during an assessment or studying will depend on the learning objectives, course and school. For advice around how and when to use AI, contact your lecturer, school, personal tutor or supervisor.

If you use AI in other ways than what the lecturer says, it may be seen as contract cheating.

This guidance is for undergraduates and PGT students. See our [guidance for PGR students on the use of AI tools in thesis writing](/academic-quality/pg/ai-tools-and-thesis-writing/).

## Artificial intelligence (AI) assessment categories

Your assessment will be given one of the following categories:

**Category 1: prohibited (not allowed)**

You cannot use AI tools at all, including spelling and grammar checkers.

**Category 2: minimal (a little)**

You can use AI tools for spelling and grammar check. You can use it for rewording occasional phrases, but not sentences, large parts of text or paragraphs. It should not change the meaning or the context of your work.

If you have not been given any other instructions, use this as the default category for your assessment and studying.

**Category 3: selective (certain tasks)**

AI tools can be used in certain ways. Your lecturer will tell you what you can use it for.

However, you do not have to use AI tools in your work. You will not be given extra credit for using it.

**Category 4: integral (important)**

AI tools are needed for the assessment. You will be told which tools to use and in what capacity.

## Use of translation tools

Translation tools may only be used for assessments if the assessment brief specifically allows it (for example, annotating or improving on an AI translation).

## Uploading information into Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Do not upload university-sensitive data into AI tools unless you have been given permission by academic staff. This includes:

* intellectual property
* personal information
* research data

This list is not exhaustive. If you are not sure, speak to your lecturer or school

## How to use AI to study

[Study skills AI tutorial](https://alt.content.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/courses/Study_Skills/using-ai-at-university/index.html? "Study skills AI tutorial") explores how AI can support your learning.

The [library's AI guide helps](https://bristol.libguides.com/ai-and-the-library) you to critically reflect on the role of AI in academic research processes, such as finding literature and summarising texts.
