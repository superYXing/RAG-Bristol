> You were experiencing exceptional circumstances that you did not tell us about before the deadline. If this is the reason why you are appealing, the guidance below sets out the reasons that can be accepted.

If you are [making an appeal](/students/support/academic-advice/academic-appeal/) because you did not submit your [exceptional circumstances (EC)](/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/exceptional-circumstances/) form before the deadline, you must explain why.

### Acceptable reasons for not submitting an exceptional circumstances form

Your reasons will usually be accepted if both conditions are met:

* there is clear evidence that your circumstances meant you were unable to submit an EC form
* the circumstances happened within three months before the relevant EC deadline.

We will usually accept your appeal if, **leading up to** **or on** the relevant EC deadline, you:

* were hospitalised and unable to communicate
* were in prison or detained
* experienced the death of a relative or close friend
* were the victim of, or a witness to, a serious crime or incident
* experienced circumstances or a condition that affected your cognitive ability which prevented you from engaging with the EC process
* experienced or were affected by a natural disaster
* experienced a situation that caused significant shock or trauma
* experienced a situation where sharing your circumstances was not possible due to the safety or wellbeing of yourself or that of a close family member. For example, because of abuse, coercion, or other safeguarding issues.

We will usually accept your appeal if, **after** the relevant deadline, you:

* received a medical diagnosis which explains why you were unable to submit your EC form
* received a diagnosis for a disability evidencing an unmanaged condition that prevented you from submitting an EC form
* were involved in a serious crime or incident investigation, and it was not possible to disclose or get evidence at an earlier date.

### Unacceptable reasons for not submitting an exceptional circumstances form

We will usually not accept your appeal if you use any of the following as the reason:

* you were unaware of the relevant EC form deadline
* medical evidence confirming a diagnosis which does not explain why you were unable to submit your EC
* a bereavement that happened more than three months before the relevant EC deadline
* you did not want to share personal circumstances due to embarrassment or cultural reasons (the EC process is confidential)
* you realised the impact of your circumstances after receiving your results.
