* [Check the status of your form](#status-check "#status-check")

* [How we store your data](#storing "#storing")

If you have been affected by [exceptional circumstances](/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/exceptional-circumstances/ "Exceptional circumstances page"), you can ask the exam board to consider the impact they have had on your assessment(s).

The exam board decides [what action (if any) should be taken](/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/exceptional-circumstances/) to mitigate the impact on your academic performance.

## Deadline to submit your form

You should submit your EC form as soon as possible after your impacted assessment.

You must submit your form by the relevant deadline below. Your school will tell you if you have a different deadline, because you have different assessment periods.

### PGT dissertations

The deadline is 3 October 2025, 11:59 pm if you are submitting an EC form for a PGT dissertation submitted in August 2025.

### Supplementary year students

The deadline is Tuesday 23 December 2025, 11:59 pm if:

* you are taking a supplementary year in 2025/26   
  and
* a decision on your progress will be made at the Mid-year (TB-1) Exam Board. If you are unsure when a decision on your progress will be made, speak to your school.

### Reassessment period assessments

The deadline is Tuesday 4  August 2026, 11:59 pm if you are submitting an EC form for an assessment taken in the 2026 reassessment period.

### All other assessments

For all other assessments taken in TB-1 or TB-2 in 2025/26, the deadline is Tuesday 26 May 2026, 11:59 pm.

### If you miss the deadline

If you miss a deadline for a good reason (such as being in the hospital), you can [follow the academic appeals process](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/academic-appeal) after you receive your exam board outcome.

## How to complete the form

### Provide a clear explanation of the impact

You must explain the impact of the circumstance on your studies and or/assessment on your form. This will help us understand how you have been affected, and decide what mitigation is appropriate, if any, or if we can provide other support.

If you do not provide enough explanation of the circumstance and its impact upon your assessment or explain why additional mitigation is needed, your request may not be accepted.

You must submit the relevant form [and supporting documents](/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/supporting-documents/) by the stated deadline. Remember that supporting documents are not sufficient on their own.

[Open the form](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/request-exceptional-circumstances-form)

### Enter the dates affected

This may be throughout the year or during a particular assessment.

It is usually 7 days or more, but may be less in some circumstances.

* Submit a form for each [teaching block or assessment period](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/dates/#academic) affected by your circumstances.
* Submit a new form if your circumstances have gone beyond the end date of a previous form.
* You can link your forms to show where circumstances are related.

If you are submitting a form to tell us about circumstances that will affect you beyond the current date, you can select a date in the future.

For example, if you need recovery time after an operation or have an upcoming court case. This does not replace your school's normal process for planned and authorised absences.

The form will limit how far in the future you can set this date so if your circumstances continue beyond this, you will need to submit another form.

#### If you transfer course

If you transfer to a new course, you will need to submit a new form for any ongoing circumstances. This does not apply if you transfer to or from an integrated masters course.

### Select units and assessments affected

Choose the units or assessments affected by your circumstances. These need to correspond with the other information provided e.g. dates and documents.

If your exceptional circumstances are accepted, the exam board will only consider applying mitigation to the assessments or units you selected.

If you are not registered, or the wrong units show, [contact your school office](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/help/#school) before you submit the form.

### Documents to support your request

You must [submit documents to support your request](/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/supporting-documents/ "Supporting%20evidence"). You can use:

* new documents to support your request or,
* documents you have uploaded before for a previous request (as long as it still meets the requirements).

Where possible, only submit your form when you have the documents ready. If you need to submit documents after you have submitted the form, [contact your school](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/help/#school) and ensure it's been uploaded before the form's deadline.

You cannot delete files once uploaded. If you:

* upload the wrong file but you have not submitted yet, abandon the procedure and start again.
* submit your request and upload the wrong file, contact your school and ask them to remove your form. Then submit a new form with the correct file(s).

## Things to remember: tips [from Bristol SU](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/support-centre)

It is important for you to remember that:

* speaking to your tutor about an issue is not the same as submitting an EC form
* if your studies are being affected, you should still submit ECs even if you think you will pass
* if you are waiting for a diagnosis or assessment, you can still submit an EC as long as you can show how you were being affected
* if you're unsure whether your situation is an EC, ask for advice
* you should provide examples to support what you are saying in your EC form
* you should submit your form before your EC deadline
* having a study support plan (SSP) is not the same as submitting ECs, it is separate process that you need to follow.
