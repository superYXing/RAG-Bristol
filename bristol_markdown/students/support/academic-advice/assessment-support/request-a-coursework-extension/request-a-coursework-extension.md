Coursework covers written assignments due sometime in the future.

[Exams, timed assessments and practical assessments](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/) (presentations, lab-based practicals) are different to coursework, so extensions are not available.

If you are unwell, or there is another reason why you are unable to meet a due date, you can request an extension.

You should plan your work so that your submission is not delayed by short-term circumstances, such as minor illness.

It is always best to submit your work on time to avoid falling behind on other deadlines.

## Who can submit

* Undergraduate students
* Postgraduate taught students
* Postgraduate research students taking taught units.

## When to request a coursework extension

The deadline for the submission of an extension request is 48 hours before the coursework submission deadline.

If the extension request deadline has passed, [read the guidance on exceptional circumstances](/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/exceptional-circumstances/).

Work to your current due date until the school has approved an extension.

## How to request an extension

If you are a student on one of these programmes, [contact your school](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/help/#school) to request an extension:

* Year 3 MBChB Medicine (not including intercalating students)
* BVSc Veterinary Science.

All other students should use the coursework extension form.

## Complete the form

Be clear and concise but explain fully why your ability to submit your work by the due date has been affected.

* Enter your requested extension date.
* Only requests for extensions of up to seven days will normally be considered. Speak to your school first if you feel your circumstances may mean you need a longer extension.
* Only assessments eligible for an extension request are listed in the form. If you are unsure why your assessment does not appear, contact the school that owns the unit.

You need to submit a separate form for each extension requested.

[Complete the form](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/request-coursework-deadline-extension-form)

## Uploading edocuments

When possible, submit [your supporting documents](/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/supporting-documents/) when you submit your request.

Photos of injuries or procedures are not acceptable and should not be submitted.

If you need to gather documents, you have until 4 calendar days after the coursework submission deadline to submit. It is your responsibility to ensure that all documents are submitted using the online form and by the deadline. You will not be permitted to submit documents after this deadline.

Extension requests without documents will normally be rejected and late penalties will apply where appropriate.

You can upload up to 5 documents with file types JPEG, JPG or PDF.

You cannot remove files from the submission once uploaded so make sure you select the correct documents.

## What happens next

Your extension request will be reviewed by the school that owns the unit. You will receive an email either:

* approving your request and confirming your new due date
* declining your request for an extension.

If you submit your extension request close to the deadline date or choose to submit your documents later, you may not receive the outcome before the coursework deadline has passed. The original coursework deadline will continue to apply until the school has approved the extension.

Late penalties will apply to you if you submit coursework after the deadline and the extension request is rejected.

### If your extension request is declined

You should submit your work by the original due date or as soon as you can. Work submitted after the due date will receive a late penalty which reduces the mark for the assessment depending on how long after the due date it is handed in. Read the [[University regulations on penalties](/academic-quality/assessment/regulations-and-code-of-practice-for-taught-programmes/penalties/)](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/assessment/regulations-and-code-of-practice-for-taught-programmes/penalties/ "17: Penalties").

## View your assessment due dates

The assessment due date on Blackboard will not change if you have been given an extension. [Check your assessment due dates including extended due dates in eVision](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/assessment-marks).

Blackboard automatically marks anything submitted after the original deadline as 'late', but this will not affect your mark if you have submitted on or before your extended deadline.
