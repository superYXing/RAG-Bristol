## What is contract cheating

Contract cheating is a type of misconduct where someone else completes the assessment for you.  It can be in exchange for something, such as food or money.

Examples of contract cheating are:

* giving another student goods, even as little as a meal or snack.
* paying a company or an essay mill (they may try to convince you that this is not cheating).
* hiring a private tutor to write your assessment or provide extensive input.
* using artificial intelligence (AI) or chatbots to complete all or part of an assessment.

This is not a complete list.

## Use of artificial intelligence (AI) or chatbots

Some tasks may be designed to use [AI as part of your assessment](/students/support/academic-advice/using-artificial-intelligence/) or studying. If you follow exactly what has been requested by your school, this will not be considered contract cheating.

## How to avoid contract cheating

Contract cheating companies often use social media to target university students. If you have been targeted, please speak to your personal tutor or your school for advice and support.

If you are stressed about a deadline or your personal circumstances, contact:

* your personal tutor, or
* [Students' Union Academic Advice team](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/support/academic-advice) (for free impartial advice)

## The risks of contract cheating

You might:

* get caught by us (the University). See [our procedures for how we investigate](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/assessment/regulations-and-code-of-practice-for-taught-programmes/academic-misconduct/).
* get blackmailed by the company, person or essay mill into paying more money.
* struggle to find work in future as your skills would not have developed.

If this happens to you, we suggest you let your department/school or the [Students' Union Academic Advice Team](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/support/academic-advice) know.

## What happens if you are contract cheating

If we think you have contract cheated in your work, you may need to attend a meeting with staff in your school to discuss this. During the meeting, we will explain why we think you have contract cheated and ask how you created your work.

If you are the person who completes another student's work for them, you may also face disciplinary action [under our regulations](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/secretary/student-rules-regs/#:~:text=University%20Acceptable%20Behaviour%20Policy%20(PDF%2C%20149kB)).

If you are being investigated for contract cheating, you can contact our [Students' Union Academic Advice team](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/support-centre/academic-advice) for free and impartial advice and support.
