We take pride in developing your academic skills. This includes:

* Being able to express your own ideas and evidence your independent thought.
* Critical thinking and the ability to compare other people's theories and evaluate evidence to reach your own conclusions.
* An ability to clearly reference other people's ideas and therefore implicitly show that all other work is your own.
* Being able to describe your own research and investigations.
* Expertise in the English language: Assessing this appropriately is a condition the University must meet in order to be allowed to award degrees at all levels.

We (the University) consider the **use of AI or translation tools to be cheating**if used for more than:

* generating the occasional short phrase within a sentence
* checking basic grammar and spelling.

Some assessments may allow more comprehensive use of these tools, but this will be detailed in your assessment instructions.

More guidance can be found in the [University's AI study skills module](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/courses/Study_Skills/using-ai-at-university/). If you are using tools provided by us or other services, such as Disabled Students' Allowance, you are expected to use these tools appropriately.

These skills illustrate academic integrity and include the [values of trust, respect, fairness and honesty](#values) in your work.

When these values are not displayed, poor academic integrity questions the quality and value of your degree. This erodes confidence in University of Bristol graduates and can harm the value of our degrees in the workplace and for acceptance into further study.

It is in your own interest to make sure the integrity of your degree is upheld.

## Academic misconduct

Academic misconduct includes:

1. [plagiarism](/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/plagiarism/)
2. [collusion](/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/collusion/)
3. [contract cheating, including the use of artificial intelligence such as chatbots](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/contract-cheating/)
4. [ethical breaches in research tasks](/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/ethical-breach/)

## Penalties

We take academic integrity seriously and will take action if we detect any misconduct. You must be aware that if we catch you carrying out such an act there will be significant implications for you. It can result in you having:

* your mark reduced
* to redo the work for credit only
* failed units
* the incident included in future references damaging your employment prospects
* susceptibility to being blackmailed in the future by unscrupulous contract cheating companies
* to leave the University without your degree
* a delay to your academic progression or graduation while your case is investigated
* to enter the workplace unprepared due to missed knowledge, resulting in you being unable to thrive in your chosen career.

## Report an incident of academic misconduct

We know most students work to the highest standards of academic integrity.

If you are concerned about an incident of academic misconduct, speak with your personal tutor or a member of school staff that you trust. They will work with you, in confidence, to take the matter forward. Alternatively, if you prefer to speak with someone outside your school you can contact:

* the Associate Pro Vice Chancellor (Education and Students) for your faculty
* the [Student Complaints Manager](/secretary/contact/).

## Our shared values of academic integrity

* **Honesty**: we are honest with ourselves and each other, this is the foundation of academic integrity.
* **Trust**: we build trust between members of our community by treating each other with respect and playing fair.
* **Fairness**: we behave fairly in our interactions with each other within a culture of respect.
* **Respect**: we show respect for ourselves, through facing challenges with integrity, and for others by valuing diversity of opinion.
* **Responsibility**: we protect the personal and collective integrity of our work.
