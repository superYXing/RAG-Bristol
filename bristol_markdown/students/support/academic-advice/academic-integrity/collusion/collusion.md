## What is collusion

Collusion is when you intentionally work with someone to complete an assessment that should be done independently. It is a type of academic misconduct.

Talking to someone about a topic can be useful for sharing knowledge. But, there is a difference between working collaboratively (together), and collusion. You will be able to develop team working skills in assessments labelled as 'group work'. Otherwise, we expect you to work on your assessments by yourself.

## Differences between collaboration and collusion

Examples of collaborative working (acceptable):

* Forming a study group with your peers to help you understand a particular topic.
* Discussing generally how to approach particular assessments.
* Asking a friend if they are OK during an open book, timed assessment.

Examples of collusion (not acceptable):

* Forming a group with the intention of working together on an independent assessment by sharing answers and ways of working.
* Using WhatsApp, text messages or other instant messaging to share answers during a timed exam.
* Contacting a friend during an open book, timed assessment to share answers.

## How to avoid collusion

If there is similarity between yours and another student’s work, it will be picked up using text-matching software, Turnitin. This will suggest academic misconduct (collusion or plagiarism).

You should not:

* share your assessment answers with others.
* message someone during an online assessment and discuss answers.
* copy and paste collaborative study group notes into any part of your answer.

You should:

* work independently on your assessment unless you are told to work in a group. If you are unsure, speak to your unit director or personal tutor.
* follow instructions for each assessment.
* use your own words to express the topics and ideas.
* keep social media apps turned off during any online exams and keep your devices where they cannot distract you.

## What happens if you are suspected of collusion

Collusion is a serious offence. If we suspect collusion in your work, you may need to attend an interview with senior staff to discuss this. If you are found guilty, you will be penalised according [to university regulations](/secretary/student-rules-regs/).

If you are being investigated for collusion, you can contact our [Student Union's Academic Advice team](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/support-centre/academic-advice) for free and impartial advice.
