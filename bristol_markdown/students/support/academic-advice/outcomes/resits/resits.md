You can [[view assessment results](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/view-assessment-results/)](https://wwwdev.bris.ac.uk/aa/student-services/academic-advice/results-outcomes/view-assessment-details-and-results/) in the **View assessment details** screen in eVision. If you are required to take reassessment, your programme outcome will display as 'Resit assessment(s).'

Your unit results and assessment marks on the **View assessment details** screen, will show you if your reassessment is a resit or a supplementary assessment.

## Resit

A resit is a new assessment taken after a previous one was failed. It may be different from the original assessment in format or content, but it serves the same purpose of evaluating the required knowledge or skills.

Your eligibility for a resit is dependent on:

* the number of credit points you have achieved
* the number of attempts you have previously had at passing the unit
* if a compensated pass is applicable
* your programme type (modular or non-modular)
* your level of study (undergraduate or postgraduate)

If you pass your resit(s), your overall unit mark will be capped at the pass mark.

## Supplementary assessment

A supplementary assessment is an assessment that is taken again because:

* you deferred
* you [self-certified your absence](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/missed-exam-assessment/)
* or you missed or failed an assessment that has been affected by validated exceptional circumstances with an [impact classification of an i2](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/exceptional-circumstances/#considered) or above

Your attempt number will stay the same i.e.:

* if you were on your first attempt, you will stay on your first attempt and your unit mark will not be capped
* if you were on your second or third attempt, you will stay on that attempt and your unit mark will be capped

The number of supplementary assessment attempts permitted, will be limited by the maximum period of study on your programme (course).

## When you will do your reassessment

Reassessments are provided within the same academic year unless:

* your reassessments exceed a total of 80 credit points. You will be required to do a [supplementary year](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/supplementary-year/) to complete reassessments for the outstanding units.
* following the reassessment period, you have units outstanding (either due to missing or failing the unit). The exam board will determine if:
  + you are eligible for further attempts:
    - as [conditional progression](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/conditional-progression/)
    - or in a [supplementary year](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/supplementary-year/)
  + or you are [required to withdraw](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/required-to-withdraw/)

Reassessments normally take place in the [reassessment period](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/dates/#:~:text=Reassessment%20period,TBC). For a limited number of programmes, reassessment takes place at a different time of year – this information will be communicated to you by your School.

## Must-pass units

Some programmes have must-pass units, which cannot be compensated, these are listed in your [programme catalogue](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/Welcome.jsa) for your year of study.

You need to achieve the pass mark and any additional criteria in these units to obtain the credit and demonstrate that you are able to meet the intended learning outcomes for the programme (course).

## Preparing for your reassessments

You will be able to view reassessment details in the **View assessment details** screen in [eVision](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/assessment-marks).

Your reassessment details will provide due dates for each assessment. If an assessment is available for multiple days, the information in eVision will only show the end date.

Full details of required reassessments will be given on the relevant unit’s Blackboard site.

Ensure that you note any feedback for unit/assessments to inform preparations for reassessment. Published unit marks for this academic year will not be visible ahead of the reassessment period.

## Exceptional circumstances and reassessments

If your reassessment has been affected by exceptional circumstances, please complete an [exceptional circumstances form](https://bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/exceptional-circumstances/#how).

Previous exceptional circumstances classifications do not transfer to reassessment attempts, as the dates that you have been affected are different.

## Tuition fees

There are no additional tuition fees for resits or supplementary assessments that are taken in the same academic year they were first failed or missed.

Tuition fees will be payable if your reassessments are being taken in a supplementary year with teaching.

## Visas

If you are a Student visa holder and reassessments will change your programme (course) end date, seek [advice from Student Visa team](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/student-visa/course/) about how this may impact you.

Please be aware that your Student visa is not automatically extended.

Changes to study may also affect your eligibility for the [Graduate Route](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/after-study/graduate-route/).

## Relevant academic regulations:

Relevant sections in the [regulations and code of practice for taught programmes](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/assessment/codeonline.html) include:
