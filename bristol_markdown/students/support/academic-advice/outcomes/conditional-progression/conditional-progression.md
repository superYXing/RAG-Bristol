Conditional progression means you can continue into your next year of study, even if you have failed a unit. However, you need to pass these failed assessments to continue with your course.

You can [appeal this decision](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/academic-appeal/). 

## Criteria for conditional progression

Conditional progression is only possible under certain conditions:

* you failed a unit in the [reassessment period](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/resits/) in the summer.
  + This period confirms if you have made enough progress to go on to the next stage of study or provide an award if you are a finalist.
* you failed no more than 20 credit points, except for MA Law, which can allow up to 30 credit points.
* you are on a specific course that allows conditional progression.
  + Check your course and year of study in the [programme (course) catalogue](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/Welcome.jsa;jsessionid=D34B8D49A08A1A05BCE4B8256B1AA652).

### Next steps

You must pass your failed (outstanding) unit before the exam board will consider any results for units in your next stage of study.

If you do not achieve the required credit points for your outstanding unit after three attempts, you will have to [withdraw from the University](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/required-to-withdraw/).

You may be allowed further attempts if exceptional circumstances are accepted.

## Academic regulations

Refer to [section 31.23 of the academic regulations (PDF, 1,043kB)](/media-library/sites/academic-quality/documents/taught-code/taught-code-25-26.pdf).

## Teaching and tuition fees

Usually, you will not need to attend teaching for your conditional progression units if your record is considered good by the exam board. This will depend on your previous attendance and engagement record with this unit.

If you are required to attend teaching, there will not be any additional tuition fees for these types of units.

If you want to attend teaching for this unit, discuss with your school to see if this is possible.

## Supplementary year

You may choose to take a [supplementary year](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/supplementary-year/) instead. You would only study your failed (outstanding) unit in this year.

If you want to take a supplementary year instead of conditionally progressing, contact your school.

## Advice and support

We recommend you talk to your personal tutor or support services to get [advice and guidance](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/how-when-results-agreed/).
