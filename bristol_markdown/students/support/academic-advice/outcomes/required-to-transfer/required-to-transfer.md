> As an integrated masters student, if you have not met the requirements to progress, you may be required to transfer to a different course within the University.

If you have not met the requirements to continue on an Integrated Masters, you may need to transfer to a different course.

You can [appeal this decision](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/academic-appeal/).

## Next steps

You will get an email when your transfer is complete. You can then check your new course registration details in [Student Info](https://www.bris.ac.uk/studentinfo/).

When you register online for the next academic year, it will be for your new course.

## Advice and support

We recommend you talk to your personal tutor and support services to get [advice and guidance](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/how-when-results-agreed/).

### Funding

If you receive financial support, such as a student loan or other funding, [contact a Money Adviser](/students/support/finances/advice/) as your suitability may be affected.

It can take us up to eight weeks to notify the Student Loans Company of a change in circumstances. It can then take more time for these changes to be processed by the Student Loans Company.

### Visa

If you are on a Student visa, transferring will affect your immigration status. Contact a [Student Visa adviser](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/tier-4/course/transfer/) for advice. You may need to apply for a new visa at the point of transfer.

If you are on a Student visa and you are being transferred to a lower-level course, your visa will be shortened to match the new course end date.
