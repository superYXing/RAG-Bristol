Outcome (result) signals are usually next to your unit or assessment mark on eVision and academic transcript. They will tell you what your results mean. For example, if you need to be reassessed.

If you do not know what a word or phrase means, [check the Regulations and Code of Practice for Taught Programmes glossary](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/academic-quality/documents/taught-code/annexes/taught-code-glossary.pdf) (PDF).

**Pass**

:   You have scored enough marks to complete the unit or assessment. When shown for a unit, you received credit for the unit.

**Fail**
:   You did not achieve the pass mark. When shown for a unit, this means you did not get credit for the unit. Another signal usually replaces this.

**Absent with permission, including verified illness**
:   You were absent from your assessment or did not submit it. You submitted for [exceptional circumstances](/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/exceptional-circumstances/), and your school has accepted them.

**Absent with self-certified illness**
:   You [self-certified your absence](/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/missed-exam-assessment/) from an assessment.

**Absent without permission**
:   You were absent from your assessment or you did not submit it. You did not have an acceptable reason for this and you did not get permission from your school.

**Capped**
:   Your unit, assessment or supplementary reassessment (resit) attempt was capped at the pass mark. It could be because of [academic misconduct](/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/), or you did not meet the standard for passing.

**Compensated pass**
:   Even though you did not pass the unit, you were given credit so that you can progress.

**Credit points awarded**
:   You were given credit for the unit even though some assessments were not completed.

**Credit points not awarded**
:   You do not get credit for the unit even though you got a pass mark. This is because you failed some of the assessments.

**Fail resit on must-pass unit**
:   You did not pass a must-pass unit again. This was your reassessment attempt.

**Fail supplementary year on must-pass unit**
:   You did not pass a must-pass unit again. This was your supplementary assessment in a supplementary year.

**Fail with credit points awarded; no resit allowed**
:   Your unit result was below the pass mark, but your overall performance was enough to be given credit. You cannot retake the assessment. This mark will count towards your degree classification.

**Late penalty level 1**
:   Your assignment was up to 1 day (24 hours) late. Your school has subtracted 10 marks as a penalty. This applies to all programmes (courses).
:   The calculation of how late your assignment is will count all days, including the weekend (Saturday and Sunday). But it does not include [bank holidays and University closure days](/university/dates/).

**Late penalty level 2**
:   Your assignment was up to 2 days (48 hours) late.
:   [Non-professional programmes (courses)](#non-professional): your school has subtracted 20 marks as a penalty.   
    [Professional programmes (courses)](#professional): you will get a 0.
:   The calculation of how late your assignment is will count all days, including the weekend (Saturday and Sunday). But it does not include [bank holidays and University closure days](/university/dates/).

**Late penalty level 3**
:   Your assignment was up to 3 days (72 hours) late.
:   [Non-professional programmes (course)](#non-professional): your school has subtracted 30 marks as a penalty.  
    [Professional programmes (course)](#professional): you will get a 0.

**Late penalty level 4**
:   Your assignment was up to 4 days (96 hours) late.
:   [Non-professional programmes (course)](#non-professional): your school has subtracted 40 marks as a penalty.  
    [Professional programmes (course)](#professional): you will get a 0.

**Late penalty level 5**
:   Your assignment was up to 5 days (120 hours) late. Your mark is 0.
:   This applies to all the programmes (courses).
:   The calculation of how late your assignment is will count all days, including the weekend (Saturday and Sunday). But it does not include [bank holidays and University closure days](/university/dates/).
:   From 2025/26, we will not apply a late penalty to work submitted more than 4 days (96 hours ) late. We will consider it a non-submission and apply an [Absent without permission](#absent-permission) signal.

**Mark pending**
:   You completed the assessment but the mark is not available yet.

**Pass notwithstanding**
:   You passed the unit because you met the learning outcomes without completing the full assessment. This is used where:

    * [exceptional circumstances](/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/exceptional-circumstances/) stopped you from completing all your assessments
    * some parts of the assessment have not been available

**Pass with distinction**
:   You achieved a distinction.

**Pass with merit**
:   You achieved a merit.

**Plagiarism (penalty)**
:   A penalty was applied because of [academic misconduct](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/#academic-misconduct).

**Plagiarism supplementary resit**
:   A penalty was applied because of [academic misconduct](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/#academic-misconduct). You can complete a supplementary assessment. The attempt number will remain the same as when you tried the previous time. Your mark may be capped.

**Repeat year**
:   You can repeat the year.

**Resit**
:   You did not pass an assessment and/ or the unit. But you can do a reassessment in the same academic year. You cannot score more than the pass mark.

**Resit capped, second attempt in next academic year**
:   You did not pass an assessment and/or the unit but you can do a reassessment next year. Your unit mark for this attempt will be capped at the pass mark.   
    For postgraduate taught students, this will be your final attempt.

**Resit capped, third and final attempt next year**
:   You did not pass an assessment and/or the unit but you can do a reassessment next year. Your unit mark for this attempt will be capped at the pass mark.

**Supplementary**
:   You did not pass an assessment and/or the unit. But you can complete a supplementary assessment this academic year. Whether your unit mark is capped or not, will depend on your attempt number.

**Supplementary next academic year**
:   You did not pass an assessment and/ or the unit. But you can do supplementary reassessment next year. Whether your unit mark is capped or not, will depend on your attempt number.

**Suspended studies**
:   You [suspended your studies](/students/support/academic-advice/suspend-your-studies/) and did not complete the unit. The signal will show on any assessments and units which you have not started.

**Under investigation**
