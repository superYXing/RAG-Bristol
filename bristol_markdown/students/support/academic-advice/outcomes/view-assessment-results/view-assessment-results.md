## What to do on results day

On results day, we will email you when your marks and results are available. Students receive their results at different times. So wait until we email you.

## How to view your results

1. [log in to university website](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/assessment-marks) to view your results
2. select **view assessment details**
3. if needed, select your current programme and **next**
4. select **+ (plus)** to see unit information
5. select **reassessment details** to read about your reassessment/s

For each assessment, you will receive a “mark” and outcome next to it.

The page might load slower than usual. Wait a few minutes and try again. We will tell you if there is a technical issue.

## What you will see with your results

You will be able to see:

* assessment title
* percentage: weighting of the assessment in relation to the unit mark
* type of assessment
* mark and outcome ([what your results mean](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/your-results-mean/)). You will not see an outcome for provisional results
* reassessment attempt:
  + Uncapped attempt: you can score up to full mark
  + Capped attempt: you cannot score more than minimum pass mark
* assessment due date and time (if applicable)
* submitted date and time (if applicable).

### Unit results

For completed units, you will be able to see:

* your [unit mark and outcome](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/your-results-mean/)
* taken credits (how many credits the unit is worth)
* awarded credits (usually, after you have passed the unit).

### Programme (course) result

Your programme outcome will be on the page, below your unit outcomes for this year.

### Award (finalists only)

Your award and classification will be in the 'results' section of the assessment details page.

### Provisional results

Mid-year (TB-1) assessment marks are usually provisional. They will not be final until an exam board has reviewed them.

### Incomplete units

A unit result will not be displayed if your marks for that unit are incomplete. For example (this is not a complete list):

* if you were absent from an exam
* you have assessments in a year-long (TB-4) unit that have not happened yet.

## Reassessments

If you need to [do a reassessment](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/resits/), you can find this information on:

* year outcome
* unit result, assessment mark and outcome
* reassessment tab. This will not be available on results day, but will be available soon after.

Any published unit marks for this academic year, will not be visible before the reassessment period.

## Advice and support about academic outcomes

We recommend you talk with your personal tutor or school office about how your academic outcome affects you. You can also:

* speak to the [Students’ Union academic advice team](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/support/academic-advice)
* get [online and in-person wellbeing support](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/managing-student-life/)
* get [visa support and advice](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/contacts/) if you require a visa extension because your [course end date has changed](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/student-visa/course/).

Changes to your study may also affect your eligibility for [the graduate route](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/after-study/graduate-route/).
