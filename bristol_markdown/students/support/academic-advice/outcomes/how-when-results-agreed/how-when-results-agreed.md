You will receive results throughout the year for your assessments. But, they will not be final until the exam board confirms them. Your final result may differ from what you received earlier in the year.

## How your results are decided

### Provisional mark

Provisional marks have not been reviewed by the exam board yet. Therefore, they are not final. Assessment results are reviewed by processes such as:

Moderation:
:   When a staff member marks assessed work, someone else will check a sample of graded work to make sure the marks are being given fairly.

Double marking:
:   It is usually part of the marking process. An assessment is marked separately by two markers and then they agree on a final mark. Neither marker is aware of the other’s decision while they are marking.

Group assessments:
:   The marking criteria will state how marks are assigned to individuals and the group.

### Final mark

Your final mark will be confirmed by an exam board. They review marks awarded in assessments. They are governed by the [Regulations and code of practice for taught programmes](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/assessment/codeonline.html).

### Role of exam board

Exam boards review the results. Each case is anonymous and confidential. They decide whether you have met the programme (course)’s learning objectives (outcomes) and what your next step would be.

The next step could be:

* a decision about how you progress, for example:
  + [reassessments](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/resits/)
  + [supplementary year](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/supplementary-year/)
  + [conditional progression](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/conditional-progression/)
  + you have to [transfer to a different course](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/required-to-transfer/)
  + you [have to withdraw](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/required-to-withdraw/)
  + you can progress to the next stage of study
* a decision about your final award.

## When your results are released

### Results and reassessment dates

[Results](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/view-assessment-results/) and [reassessment dates](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/resits/) may be different for some programmes (courses), such as:

* postgraduate
* professional programmes
* the International Foundation Programme.

Your school will inform you in this case.

### TB-1 results release date

All TB1 (winter) assessment results will be released on 3 February 2026.

Mid-year exam boards meet in January after term block 1 (TB-1) assessments. They will review students who are:

* studying part-time
* on a [supplementary year](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/supplementary-year/)
* on a programme (course) with a [non-standard schedule of delivery](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/academic-quality/documents/taught-code/annexes/regulations-for-specific-programmes.pdf) (PDF) (for example, study abroad)
* submitted their postgraduate taught dissertation after an extension or resubmission and will be considered for award
* where a decision can be made about any outstanding completed units where a student has previously [conditionally progressed](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/conditional-progression/).

If you need to do a reassessment, it will be in the [reassessment period](#reassessment).

### June (TB-2) results release date

As an undergraduate or postgraduate student, you will most likely get your final marks after the exam board meets in June 2026.

Results will be released between 23 and 26 June 2026.

If you need to do a reassessment, it will be in the [reassessment period](#reassessment).

### Reassessment period in August

After the reassessment period, an exam board will meet to review your marks in August.

[Results will be released](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/view-assessment-results/) on 25 August 2026.

### Postgraduate taught finalists in November

PGT finalists will be reviewed after the final assessment has been submitted at the end of the programme (course).

## Advice and support about academic outcomes

We recommend you talk with your personal tutor or school office about how your academic outcome affects you. You can also:

* speak to the [Students’ Union academic advice team](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/support/academic-advice)
* get [online and in-person wellbeing support](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/managing-student-life/)
* get [visa support and advice](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/contacts/) if you require a visa extension because your [course end date has changed](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/student-visa/course/).

Changes to your study may also affect your eligibility for [the graduate route](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/after-study/graduate-route/).
