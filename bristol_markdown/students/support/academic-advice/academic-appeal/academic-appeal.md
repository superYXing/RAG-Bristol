## Before you make an appeal

### Early Resolution Service

Use the Early Resolution Service to raise concerns or ask questions before you submit a formal academic appeal. Early Resolution is an optional and informal process and does not change your right to submit a formal academic appeal.

You should submit the Early Resolution Service form within 14 calendar days of getting your exam board outcome

The Early Resolution Service can help you:

* understand what your [results and programme outcome](/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/view-assessment-results/) mean
* check if your marks or penalties have been recorded correctly
* confirm if [your exceptional circumstances](/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/exceptional-circumstances/undisclosed-exceptional-circumstances/) were considered by the Board of Examiners and what was done as a result
* identify if there has been an administrative error and get advice on what to do next
* check whether you have an acceptable reason for not [submitting exceptional circumstances](/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/exceptional-circumstances/undisclosed-exceptional-circumstances/)

[Submit an Early Resolution form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG3VFNbMfQ-FMl6vyPqqz50pURUZHNDFaN1JHS1hJQkNVNUhYQjRVMFJWVyQlQCN0PWcu "Early Resolution: Microsoft office form")

### Student visas

If you are on a Student visa, speak to the [Student Visa team](/directory/visas/). They can tell you how the appeal process and outcome might affect your visa status.

### Bristol SU academic advice

To get help with preparing a formal appeal, use [Bristol SU’s Academic Advice](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/support-centre/academic-advice/academic-appeals) service.

You can use the appeal wizard to create a draft form. Then the Academic Advice team will review it and provide advice, including [guidance on supporting documents to provide](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/support-centre/academic-advice/academic-appeals#Start).

Their advice is independent, free and confidential.

## When you can appeal

If you need help understanding your [exam board outcomes](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/), use the Early Resolution Service.

You can appeal against an [official decision of the Board of Examiners](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/). Your [programme outcome](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/#:~:text=Programme%20outcomes,summer%20and%20reassessment%20exam%20boards.) will state if it is possible to appeal. This is published after the Board of Examiners meeting and you will receive a notification by email.

You should only appeal if you think you have valid grounds. Appeals that do not have valid grounds will be dismissed.

You can also appeal the requirement to attend an [Academic Integrity Awareness Course](#AIAC).

## Reasons for an appeal

There are three different grounds for appeal:

#### A. Appeals relating to material irregularity

There has been a material irregularity in the decision-making process sufficient to require that the decision can be reconsidered. Examples of this are if the University has not applied its regulations correctly or if the Board of Examiners failed to consider exceptional circumstances that you had submitted before the board meeting.

#### B. Appeals relating to undisclosed exceptional circumstances

Before appealing on this ground, read our guidance on [appeals based on undisclosed exceptional circumstances](/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/exceptional-circumstances/undisclosed-exceptional-circumstances/).

Your performance in assessment was affected by illness or other factors ([exceptional circumstances](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/exceptional-circumstances/)) which you were unable, for good reason, to divulge before the meeting of the Board of Examiners. Your appeal will need to explain clearly why you could not submit these in advance of the exceptional circumstances form deadline. 

#### C. Appeals relating to disproportionate impact

A penalty for cheating or plagiarism is wrong or has had a disproportionate impact on your outcome.

## When you cannot appeal

You can't challenge matters of academic judgement. These are decisions that can only be made with the opinion of an academic expert, including decisions about what mark you have been given for a piece of academic work. Submitting exceptional circumstances does not mean your marks will change (except where a late submission penalty or word count penalty has been lifted).

You can only appeal against an official decision of the Board of Examiners as indicated in your [programme outcome](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/#:~:text=Programme%20outcomes,summer%20and%20reassessment%20exam%20boards.). Decisions about progression are usually made official at the end of the academic year in June (or in August where you have completed work during the reassessment period). Award decisions are normally made for undergraduate students in June, and for postgraduate taught students in November or December. In most cases, appeals are not permitted following mid-year exam boards, which take place in January.

If the appeal procedure is not applicable you may wish to [make a complaint](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/complaints/). A complaint is not another way to challenge a Board of Examiners decision or academic judgement.

## How to make an academic appeal

You have 21 days (includes weekends but not public holidays in England or [university closure days](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/dates/#closure)) to submit an academic appeal from the date you receive your decision.

You should submit your appeal as soon as possible to help you prepare for your next academic year.

1. Download a [Student Appeal Form](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bristol.ac.uk%2Fmedia-library%2Fsites%2Fsecretary%2Fdocuments%2Fstudent-rules-and-regs%2FStudent-Appeal-Form.docx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK).‌
2. Read the [University Assessment Regulations (PDF, 337kB)](/media-library/sites/currentstudents/documents/university-assessment-regulations.pdf), Section 12.
3. [Organise any documents](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/assessment-support/evidence/) you believe support your appeal. All supporting documents should be submitted with the appeal form. If there is a good reason why you cannot submit supporting documents at the same time as the form, please submit the form as soon as you can with an explanation of what supporting documents are outstanding. Do not delay submitting the form.
   * Complete all sections of the appeal form.
   * Keep your responses clear, succinct, and within the recommended word counts.
   * You may want to include a timeline, use bullet points, or cite relevant regulations to help set out your information.
   * When submitting supporting documents, give each one a clear name and use that name whenever you mention it in your appeal form.
   * Clearly outline which outcome you want.
4. Your university email account will close soon after your studies end. Make sure on your appeal form that you provide another email address to your university address.
5. Email the completed form and all supporting documents to [student-appeals@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:student-appeals@bristol.ac.uk).

## If you miss the deadline

If you cannot submit your appeal by the deadline, email a completed [late appeal request form](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/secretary/student-rules-regs/#:~:text=Late%20Appeal%20Request%20Form) to [appeal-progression@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:appeal-progression@bristol.ac.uk).

## While you are awaiting your outcome

Until you receive the outcome of your appeal, the exam board decision as published still applies.  

You must follow the exam board decision and complete any work required. Do not assume that your appeal will be successful. It may not be possible to process an appeal against the requirement to complete a supplementary year of study before the start of the next academic year or in time for you to re-join your programme in your original cohort.

Failure to follow the programme outcome that you have been given may affect your progression or award.

## **What happens after you submit an appeal**

1. The Student Resolution Service will acknowledge receipt of your appeal by email to your university email address and any others you provide on your appeal form. They will contact you if further information is required, or if your form is not fully completed.
2. Your Faculty will review your appeal.
3. The Student Resolution Service will keep you updated on the progress of your appeal.
4. You will receive the outcome with next steps by email. This usually arrives within 35 days (includes weekends but does not include [public holidays in England or University closure days](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/dates/#closure)) of submitting your appeal.
5. If you do not hear the outcome within 35 days, you can contact the Student Resolution Service by email: [student-appeals@bristol.ac.uk](http://stu) for an update.

## Potential appeal outcomes

When making an appeal, you should ensure you are clear on which outcome you are seeking. Possible outcomes include:

* permission to progress to next year of study;
* permission to undertake a [supplementary year](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/outcomes/supplementary-year/) to complete failed unit(s) to satisfactory standard (this may be with or without attendance);
* permission to repeat the year in its entirety;
* permission to re-register for programme of study following a required to withdraw decision;
* permission to remain on programme of study and not be required to transfer to alternative programme of study;
* uplift of degree classification;
* removal of penalties or caps to unit/assessment level outcomes.

You cannot use the appeals process to ask for your work to be re-marked.

## After receiving your appeal outcome

The appeal outcome letter will include information on next steps, including how to progress your appeal if you are not satisfied with the outcome, as detailed in the [University Assessment Regulations](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/currentstudents/documents/university-assessment-regulations.pdf), Section 12. You will receive this letter by email directly from your faculty.

You should be aware of section 12.7 of the University Assessment Regulations. This states that appeals will not be permitted at the University Stage if one or more of the requested outcomes has been permitted at the Local Stage.

If you are dissatisfied with your local stage outcome, you can appeal to the University stage by completing the [Appeal Progression Form](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bristol.ac.uk%2Fmedia-library%2Fsites%2Fsecretary%2Fdocuments%2Fstudent-rules-and-regs%2Fstudent-appeal-progression-form.docx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK) and sending it to [appeal-progression@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:appeal-progression@bristol.ac.uk) within 14 days (includes weekends but does not include [public holidays in England or university closure days](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/dates/#closure)) of the local stage decision. More information will be provided in your local stage outcome letter.

## Other types of appeal

### Academic Integrity Awareness Course

You can appeal the requirement to attend an Academic Integrity Awareness Course (AIAC).

You have 21 days (including weekends) to appeal from the day you are contacted about attending an AIAC. This does not include English public holidays or [university closure days](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/dates/#closure).

To appeal, you must:

1. Download the [Academic Integrity Awareness Course appeal form (Office document, 61kB)](/media-library/sites/currentstudents/documents/Academic Integrity Awareness Course appeal form.docx)
2. Complete all sections
3. Submit the form to [student-appeals@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:student-appeals@bristol.ac.uk)

### After you submit your appeal

Your Faculty will review your appeal and decide whether to confirm or remove your requirement to attend the AIAC.

You must still attend the AIAC while your appeal is under review.
