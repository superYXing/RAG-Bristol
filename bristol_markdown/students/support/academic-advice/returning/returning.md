> All returning students need to register before you start your studies.

All returning students need to re-register each year. This includes students studying on a distance learning basis, on placements, study abroad, those on supplementary years and those on research or visiting student programmes.

If you do not re-register, you could lose access to University buildings and services. It could also affect your funding, scholarships, Student Loans Company payments, and council tax exemption.

## Register for your next year of study

When you register, you will check and update your personal details and accept the Student Agreement. You must keep your contact details up to date during your studies so we can contact you.

### Deadlines for returning students to register

#### September 2025 starters

The latest date for registration is 10 am on 6 October 2025.

#### January 2026 starters

The latest date for registration is 10 am on 19 January 2026.

### Unable to register

If you cannot register by the deadline, you must notify your [Faculty office](/faculties/) and register by the latest registration date for your course.

### How to register

1. Login to [Student info](https://www.bris.ac.uk/studentinfo/) (use a laptop or computer instead of a phone).

If your nationality indicates you may require a visa, you will need to complete a [student document check (right to study)](/students/new/before-you-arrive/register/right-to-study-check/ "Right-to-Study%20check") if:

* you are returning to the University after a suspension
