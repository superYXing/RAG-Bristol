It is not unusual to have doubts about your course or university at some point. You might consider whether you want to leave altogether.

This is a big decision, so it is important to think through the alternatives and whether it is the best option for you.

## Think about why you want to withdraw

We recommend you start by talking to:

* your [personal tutor](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/personal-tutors/)
* senior tutor or supervisor (if you are a research student)
or* another member of your school.

They can offer support and advice including other options you may have available. Visit the [academic advice pages](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/) for further information.

You could get further advice by speaking to:

* our [wellbeing advisers](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/request-support/services/),
* [Students Union Academic Advice Service](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/support/academic-advice)
* the [Student Finances Advice team](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/)
* the [Careers Service](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/careers/contacts/).

There is also support available for [students who are experiencing financial difficulties](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/emergency-funds/).

## What happens if you withdraw

Before making a final decision, you need to be aware of what leaving university will mean. Our teams can help talk you through what will happen.

### Tuition fees

Your tuition fees will be adjusted according to the [tuition fee refund policy](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/tuition-fees/refunds/). This will depend on your last date of attendance. View the [Tuition fee refunds](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/tuition-fees/refunds/) webpage for more information. You can also learn more, before submitting this withdrawal request, by:

* visiting our page about the [financial considerations of withdrawing from study](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/advice/suspending/)
* [speaking to a Money Adviser.](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/)

### Your funding

Withdrawing may affect your eligibility for funding and student loans if you return. If you have any questions before submitting this withdrawal request, you should:

* view the [financial considerations of withdrawing from study](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/advice/suspending/) webpage
* [speak to a Money Adviser](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/).

If you are funded by the [Student Loans Company](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/student-loans/), we will inform them of your withdrawal. If you are funded by an external sponsor, you should contact them to inform them of your withdrawal.

### Visa

If you are a Student visa holder, read the [Student visa guidance.](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/tier-4/course/withdrawing/) Do this before you decide to withdraw. It will let you understand what the impact will be on your immigration status.

Once you withdraw from your studies, we are required by law to notify the UKVI. They will cancel your visa and you will have to leave the UK. You can speak to a Student Visa Adviser if you would like further advice.

### Accommodation

#### Living in University accommodation

If you have withdrawn, you will need to move out of your University accommodation. This is because you will no longer be classified as a student.

You need to inform your student accommodation that you have withdrawn. Do this by completing the intention to leave form via the [Accommodation Portal](https://bristol.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortalX/3B88D738/8/9/Login-Login). If you do not complete the intention to leave form, you will remain liable for the rent of your room.

Find out more about [your rent responsibilities](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/university-accommodation/rent-contracts-regulations/cancel-your-tenancy/#leave) after withdrawing from your studies.

#### Living in private-rented accommodation

It is unlikely that you will be able to end a private tenancy agreement early if you withdraw. You will no longer be eligible for council tax exemption after withdrawal.

#### Returning to University accommodation

You might return to your studies and want to live in University accommodation again. In this case you will need to apply for [returner accommodation](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/life-in-bristol/accommodation/apply-to-stay-in-university-accommodation/returner-accommodation/). It is important to note that returner accommodation is very limited.

### Access to university services

* Your [UCard](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cardservices/) will no longer give you access to buildings.
* You will not have access to systems that need a university login.
* You should prepare for losing access to IT services (such as your email account). Follow the checklist on the [Leaving the University](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/it/leaving-the-university/) webpage.
* You will no longer have access to [Student Support services.](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/) This includes the Wellbeing Services.

### Careers Service

You can use our [Careers Service](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/careers/) for up to three years after you leave, to help get where you want to be.

### Exit award

You may be eligible for an exit award. This is if you have passed units in one or more years of study, but do not have enough credits for your full award.

For example:

* Undergraduate students who withdraw from a bachelor’s honours degree may receive:
  + a Certificate of Higher Education if they have completed 120 credit pointsor

+ a Diploma of Higher Education if they have completed 240 credit points.

* Postgraduate taught students who withdraw from a taught master's degree may receive:
  + a Postgraduate Certificate if they have completed 60 credit pointsor

+ a Postgraduate Diploma if they have completed 120 credit points.

Refer to section 4 in the academic regulations.
