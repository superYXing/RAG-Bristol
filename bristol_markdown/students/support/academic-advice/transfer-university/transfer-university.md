> What to do if you are thinking of transferring to another university

If you’re thinking about moving to a different university, speak to your personal tutor or supervisor for advice.

## How to transfer

* Contact your new university directly to check if they will admit you to the next year of the course you want to study once you've completed a year at Bristol. If they are willing to accept your application, you must withdraw from your studies at Bristol before registering on your new programme.
* If you can’t be admitted to a later year, you may need to apply to start again from the first year of your new course.
* For undergraduate courses, you will normally be required to apply through UCAS.
* Postgraduate research students should speak to their supervisor, School PGR Director or local PGR administrative team.

## Funding and finance

Your transfer may affect your eligibility for funding and student loans. If you receive financial support, [speak to a Money Adviser](https://bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/advice/) before you transfer.

You may still be liable to pay some or all of the tuition fees for your current course. For a detailed explanation, read the [Student Fees Regulations](/secretary/student-rules-regs/). You should also check how much the fees are for your new course.

### Notifying the Student Loans Company

It can take the University up to eight weeks to notify the Student Loans Company of a change in circumstances. It can then take more time for these changes to be processed by the Student Loans Company. Your funding may be affected during this process.

## International students

[Please refer to the Student Visa Services](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/tier-4/course/transfer/) webpages before requesting a transfer as you may be required to apply for a new visa.

## Degree classification

Transferring to a new university may change how your final degree classification (such as 2:1 or distinction) is worked out. For example, another university may not count your second year towards your final award. Check their academic regulations so you're clear about any differences.
