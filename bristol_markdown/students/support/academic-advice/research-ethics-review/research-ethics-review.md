> All research within the University involving human participants, tissue and/or data must have a research ethics review.

All researchers are responsible for doing research in an ethical manner. You must get a favourable ethics opinion before you collect any data.

If your research is undergoing an NHS or social care ethical review you do not need a secondary ethical review by the University. You will need to [contact the research governance team](mailto:research-governance@bristol.ac.uk) to organise sponsorship arrangements.

## Get a research ethics review for your project

Each faculty has a research ethics committee which grants an ethical opinion on research proposals. If you're not sure whether you need to apply for ethics review, speak to your supervisor or [contact the Research Ethics and Integrity Manager](mailto:Liam.McKervey@bristol.ac.uk).

Refer to the Statement on Research Integrity for further information.

## Ethics in research

Important issues relating to ethics in research include:

* protecting the rights, dignity, health, safety and privacy of research subjects
* always working with permission
* respecting copyright
* fair representation
* data protection
* working within the law
* respecting the environment, places, people, traditions, customs, and objects, including human remains.

## Apply for a research ethics review

Submit your ethics application using the  [Online Research Ethics Management System](https://orems.bristol.ac.uk/ActivityForm/Index) (OREMS) along with supporting documentation for your research.

You will need to upload all participant-facing study documents, such as:

* recruitment adverts, messages or forms
* [Participant information sheet (Office document, 52kB)](/media-library/sites/currentstudents/documents/Participant information sheet.docx) or transcript
* [Consent form for an adult participant (Office document, 55kB)](/media-library/sites/currentstudents/documents/Consent form for an adult participant.docx)‌‌
* [Consent form for an adult on behalf of a child participant (Office document, 48kB)](/media-library/sites/currentstudents/documents/Consent form for an adult on behalf of a child participant.docx)
* debriefing sheet or transcript
* questionnaires
* any other relevant material, such as an unpublished questionnaire enquiring about possibly sensitive topics or collecting personal data.

The Research Ethics Administrator will arrange a review of your application with the appropriate ethics committee.

Contact [research-ethics@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:research-ethics@bristol.ac.uk) if you have any questions about:

* submitting a research ethics application
* the status of your application.

## The decision process

Once the committee has reviewed your application, the Research Governance Administrator will send you the committee’s opinion by email. There are three possible outcomes:

### Favourable ethical opinion

The committee confirms that it has a favourable opinion of your ethics application.

### Conditional ethical opinion

The committee outlines the issues that you need to address before it can provide a formal favourable ethical opinion.

### Unfavourable ethical opinion

The committee explains the reasons for its decision, and you need to resubmit your research ethics application.

## Right to appeal

You have a right to appeal to the University Ethics of Research Committee on any decision, through [the committee representative for your faculty](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/red/research-governance/ethics/uni-ethics/#committees).
