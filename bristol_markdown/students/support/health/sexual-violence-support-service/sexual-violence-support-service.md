> We support students who have experienced any form of sexual misconduct, regardless of when or where it happened. Sexual misconduct is any kind of unwanted sexual activity, which does not always include physical contact.

In an emergency, do not submit a referral form. Call the [emergency services on 999](tel:999).

### Contact us about our sexual violence support service

* would like to ask about the service

**Please do not use this email to share detailed information about an incident of sexual violence.**

### External support services

You can also access a range of [resources and external services](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/health/report-unacceptable-behaviour/sexual-misconduct/#services). We have a range of support information [focusing on consent](/students/support/health/report-unacceptable-behaviour/sexual-misconduct/sexual-consent/).

## Our approach to providing sexual violence support

We:

* will believe you and be led by you. You will be in control of what you do or don’t do next.
* will ensure you are being supported without having to relive your experiences.
* provide a safe space where you will be listened to without judgement.
* treat everyone as an individual and recognise that life experiences and identity can impact on your experience of sexual violence.
* work under the [Education and Student Success confidentiality statement](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/policies/student-services-confidentiality-statement/) which means there are times we may be required to share information outside of the service – if there was a significant risk to you or another student, for example. We will always discuss this with you.

## What to expect from our sexual violence service

We will:

* discuss immediate safety options with you and help organise these if needed.
* help you navigate options for specialist support, including making referrals where necessary. This might include support particular to your needs or identity, such as LGBTQ+ support or support for male survivors.
* talk through resources and methods to help you understand and process your responses to what has happened.
* help liaise with your school if your studies are being impacted, without disclosing details of your experience.
* support you throughout the reporting process, if you choose to [make a report through the university](/students/support/health/report-unacceptable-behaviour/sexual-misconduct/).
* liaise with your Independent Sexual Violence Adviser if you have made a report through the police.

## Refer someone else to our sexual violence support service

If you are worried about someone, you can [refer on their behalf](/students/support/managing-student-life/help-someone/).

## How you can support someone

When someone you know shares that they have experienced sexual misconduct or harassment, it may feel overwhelming. You can help your friend feel heard, safe and empowered:

* listen and believe what they say.
* let them know you are there for them.
* reassure them that their feelings are normal.
* be patient, open-minded, and respect their decisions**.** Everyone reacts to trauma differently. There is no right way to feel or respond.
* encourage, do not pressure. You can support them in taking steps only when they feel comfortable and ready.

Hearing about sexual violence can be upsetting. To look after yourself too, you can [book a wellbeing appointment](/students/support/managing-student-life/book-an-appointment/).

## Emergency support

If you have experienced sexual violence of any kind within the last seven days, we urge you to seek support without delay as there is a timeframe within which evidence can be gathered.

Your [local sexual assault referral centre (NHS website)](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/sexual-health-services/find-a-rape-and-sexual-assault-referral-centre) offers support 24 hours a day, everyday. They can help you understand your options, including anything which is time-critical, whether you choose to formally report or not.
