> We work with students who have been referred with complex mental health difficulties.

When you [book a wellbeing appointment](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/managing-student-life/book-an-appointment/) our wellbeing advisers will direct you to the most suitable support or service. If it's suitable, they may refer you for support from the Mental Health Advisory Service. The Students’ Health Service can also refer you to this service.

## What happens if you are referred

You will have a session with one of our mental health advisers. They will work with you to explore your mental health difficulties and create a care plan with you.

Your care plan will focus on your strengths and help you find the right support at University and in the wider community. It might also include support from other services, such as the NHS and other University services and resources.

## Confidentiality

We will not share your information with anyone without your permission. However, we encourage you to share your care plan with everyone supporting you. Our support will be limited if you do not give us permission to work with other services that are supporting you.

## Prepare for your session

It is useful to have the following information ready, so it is available for your session:

* any care plans that have helped you in the past
* contact details of people and services that support you, such as NHS services at home or your personal tutor

## After your session

We may book more sessions with you if you agree, or one session may be enough if you are referred to other appropriate services to help you.
