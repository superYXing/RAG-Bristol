> Our Student Counselling Service and Mental Health Advisory Service are available by referral if you are experiencing problems with your mental health at university.

## Accessing mental health support

If you feel that you need support for your mental health, you should book an appointment with your GP, or with a Wellbeing adviser. They can provide you with a referral to a support service if it is right for you.

You cannot book an appointment directly with the Student Counselling or Mental Health Advisory Service, you must get a referral first.

## Student Counselling Service

The Student Counselling Service offers short-term individual counselling with experienced counsellors.

They also offer therapeutic groups where you can discuss your issues with peers, led by a trained counsellor. These include:

* Chinese-speaking
* CBT for anxiety
* interpersonal/relationship
* bereavement
* trans students
* perfectionism

### We use the one-at-a-time (OAAT) model for counselling

One at a time is a short-term counselling model that gives you the flexibility to ask for counselling when you need it most.

You book each session as you go.

Learn more about one-at-a-time counselling in [our short YouTube video](https://youtu.be/T6N2aH1cBro).

### Counselling with Nilaari

Nilaari is a community-based counselling charity. If we are unable to provide a counsellor that represents your needs (for example, certain ethnicity or language), [Nilaari may be able to help](https://www.nilaari.co.uk/). Contact them on [+44 (0)117 952 5742](tel:01179525742) for up to six free counselling sessions.

## Mental Health Advisory Service

The Mental Health Advisory Service works with students who have been referred with complex mental health difficulties.

If you are referred, a mental health advisor will create a care plan for you which will focus on your strengths and help you find the right support at University and in the wider community.
