> How to get support if you are worried you have hurt someone.

## On this page:

* [Support to help you make positive behaviour changes](#support)
* [If you think you have been reported for unacceptable behaviour](#reported)

How we behave and understand others is an important part of growing as a person.

It can be difficult to realise when your behaviour is hurting others (even if the intention was good) and seek help. But, support is available; understanding yourself and what has happened can be really helpful.

## If someone has told you that you have hurt them

* Listen to them without interrupting.
* Take time and space away from them if you need to process what you’ve heard or are feeling angry or upset.
* If they need time and space away from you, accept this and do not put any pressure on them.
* Take responsibility for the hurt which they have described.
* Be led by them about what should happen next. Be prepared that one or both of you may want to end your relationship (romantic or friendship).
* Take actions to understand your behaviour, the impacts, and how to handle future relationships.

## Support to help you make positive behaviour changes

### University support options

You can [book an appointment with an Adviser](/students/support/managing-student-life/book-an-appointment/) from our Student Wellbeing or Residential Life Services for advice and support.
