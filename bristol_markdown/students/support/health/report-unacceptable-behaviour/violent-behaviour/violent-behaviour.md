## Get support

If you have experienced unacceptable behaviour, we are here to help you:

* [request wellbeing support](/students/support/managing-student-life/book-an-appointment/) if you want to talk to someone
* [get advice](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/health/report-unacceptable-behaviour/how-to-report/#support) about your options by contacting the Student Resolution Service
* report a student’s behaviour by [filling out our form](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/health/report-unacceptable-behaviour/how-to-report/#report).

## Violent behaviour

Violent behaviour is when an individual or a group attacks a person physically, with or without the use of a weapon. It can include:

* scratching, pushing, kicking and punching
* throwing things
* using weapons
* physically restraining another person.

Threats of violence and unsuccessful attempts to injure someone (for example if an item is thrown but does not actually hit someone) are also considered to be violent behaviour.

## Threatening behaviour

Threatening behaviour is saying or doing something that makes another person fear they might be harmed. Examples include:

* telling someone you will hurt them
* making signals that suggest violence
* writing messages that suggest harm.

Threats do not have to be direct or clearly stated. If someone reasonably feels scared for their safety because of someone’s words or actions, it can be considered threatening.

## Intimidating behaviour

Intimidating behaviour aims to frighten, pressure, or dominate someone. It might include:

* standing very close to scare someone
* using aggressive body language
* staring at someone
* speaking in a way that is meant to make someone feel powerless
* repeatedly contacting someone in a way that causes them distress or makes them feel unsafe.

These rules apply both in person and online, including emails, messaging apps, and social media posts.
