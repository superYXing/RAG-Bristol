> What you can do if you are worried about someone else's behaviour towards others.

If someone's life is in immediate danger, [call 999](tel:999).

If you are on campus, call 999 and then call Security Services on [+44(0)117 331 1223](tel:+441173311223).

You may see behaviour that you feel is inappropriate. It can be difficult to know what to do in this situation.

## Suggestions for intervening

Your safety is your priority. Only intervene when it is safe for you to do so. If it is not safe, you can intervene later or get help from others.

* **Distract:** create a distraction so the person who is experiencing the unacceptable behaviour can leave
* **Talk:** explain to the person who is doing the unacceptable behaviour why it is unacceptable
* **Give support:** explain to the person who is experiencing unacceptable behaviour the support options they have
* **Report:** you can report the behaviour to the university or the police.

## Get support for someone you are worried about

If you are concerned about a student, you can [request support for them](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/managing-student-life/help-someone/).

If you are not sure who to contact about someone else’s behaviour, you can [book a wellbeing appointment](/students/support/managing-student-life/book-an-appointment/) for advice and support.
