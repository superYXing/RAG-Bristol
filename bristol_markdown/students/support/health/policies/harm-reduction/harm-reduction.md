## Harm reduction approach

You may choose to use drugs or drink alcohol while at university. If you do, we want to make sure you can make an informed decision. This includes supporting you and guiding you to helpful resources.

We will not punish you for discussing drug or alcohol use. Instead, we will offer support and signpost you to helpful resources.

## Supply of illegal drugs or alcohol

Supplying illegal drugs or unlawful supply of alcohol is prohibited (banned). If you are involved in the supply of drugs:

* you may be [disciplined by the University (PDF)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/secretary/documents/student-rules-and-regs/Student-Disciplinary-Regulations.pdf "Student disciplinary regulations (PDF)"), and
* referred to the police.

Anti-social and criminal behaviour are not accepted. This will be addressed through the [Student disciplinary regulations (PDF, 236kB)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/secretary/documents/student-rules-and-regs/Student-Disciplinary-Regulations.pdf "Student disciplinary regulations (pdf)").
