> Read important policies and statements about our wellbeing provision and services.

## University Mental Health Charter (UMHC)

We are committed to making mental health and wellbeing a University-wide priority. We are proud to have been given a [University Mental Health Charter Award](https://hub.studentminds.org.uk/university-mental-health-charter/charter-award-holders/) by [Student Minds](https://www.studentminds.org.uk/). This voluntary accreditation scheme acknowledges our commitment and ongoing progress towards to the [UMHC Framework](https://hub.studentminds.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UMHC-Framework-Updated_2024.pdf).

We are also members of the Student Minds’ University Mental Health Charter Programme. This programme brings together universities to share practice and create cultural change.

This [article about the award](https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2022/december/bristol-receives-mental-health-charter.html) has more information on our whole-University approach. You can read the latest information about UMHC news and events from Student Minds [on the Hub](https://hub.studentminds.org.uk).

## Consent to contact a parent or supporter

We recognise our students as independent adults. We therefore need your consent to talk to anyone outside the University about you, including a parent or guardian.

All students must provide emergency contact details, which will be used in any emergency, but you can also opt in to allow the university to inform your emergency contact when we have concerns about your welfare.

Find out more about how and when we [use your emergency contact details](/students/support/health/policies/emergency-contact/) and the options available to you.

## Coronavirus (COVID-19) survey

During the summer term of 2020, the University and Bristol SU asked students to share their experiences of education and wellbeing during the pandemic.

As a result of student feedback, we've made changes to many areas of support for both wellbeing and study. Find out what we've done.
