> The ‘joint commitment’ sets out ways in which we will be making sure that students affected by sexual violence or harassment are supported.

Made by the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/sexual-assault-or-harassment/), [Bath Spa University](https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/students/student-wellbeing-services/sexual-violence-prevention-and-support/), University of Bristol, [UWE Bristol](https://reportandsupport.uwe.ac.uk/), and their respective Students’ Unions.

The Vice-Chancellors from each of the universities, and The Students’ Unions’ Presidents and Officers commit to the following:

* We will work to ensure our staff take a person-centred approach to support students affected by sexual violence or harassment. You will be heard, listened to, and supported by your University and Students’ Union.
* Sexual violence and harassment will not be tolerated by the Universities or Students’ Unions.
* We will raise awareness of appropriate support and organisations to aid the recovery of students that have been affected by sexual violence and harassment.
* Students will be supported to report sexual violence or harassment should they wish to do so. This includes through external organisations.
* We will work together across the University of Bath, Bath Spa University, University of Bristol and UWE Bristol where cases include individuals from different institutions.
* We will provide our staff and students with the tools to speak up and address inappropriate behaviour by providing training, accessible online resources and clear reporting channels.
* The Universities and the Students’ Unions will actively work locally with external organisations to address sexual violence and harassment.
* We will work preventatively to help students understand consent and will take an educative approach to tackling sexual violence and harassment.
* We understand that certain groups are more at risk of sexual violence and harassment. We will take an intersectional approach to support.
* We will ensure that our policies and procedures are aligned to support this pledge.
