### Address

You can choose to include your address.

If you live in University-managed accommodation, your flat or room number will be included.

However, this does not prove that your address has been checked by the University.

If you need to prove your address, you should do this using another type of approved document.

### If your details are incorrect

Your details are from your student record.

If they are incorrect, you should [update your details online](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/your-record/contact/) before you create a student status letter.

## Extra information

In some cases, you may need to confirm details not included in the standard student status letter. Contact Student Services to request a letter. Student services can advise on what can and cannot be added.
