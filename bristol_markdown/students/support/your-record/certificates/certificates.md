> At the end of your studies, you will receive a certificate. Find out how you will receive yours and what to do if you need a replacement.

A certificate is a formal confirmation of your award.

## Students on graduating courses

We will post your certificate to you after you graduate. The next graduation ceremonies will be in February 2026.

Students who defer their graduation will receive their certificate at the time of the deferred ceremony, according to the procedure in place for that congregation.

## Students on non-graduating courses

Your certificate will be posted within 21 days of your award being confirmed by the Exam Board.

## Recent graduates: My certificate has not arrived

Allow up to a month for certificates to be delivered to UK addresses and 6 weeks for overseas addresses.

If you have outstanding obligations to the University, such as fees, your certificate will not be posted until you have settled these.

If you are a recent graduate (within 6 months of the graduation ceremony/date when your first certificate was posted) and have not received your certificate, email [exams-office@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:exams-office@bristol.ac.uk).

## Replacement certificates

If you have graduated and received your certificate, but it has since been lost, damaged or destroyed, you can order a replacement copy from the Online Shop. The fee is £50.

[Request a replacement certificate](https://shop.bris.ac.uk/product-catalogue/university-document-requests/certificates-and-verifications/requests-from-former-students/replacement-certificate)

After you place your order, you must send a copy of an official photo ID (passport, driving licence etc.) to [award-verification@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:award-verification@bristol.ac.uk).

Certificates cannot be sent digitally; only physical copies are available.

Requests must come directly from the student and certificates can only be sent to the student.

If a third party wishes to verify a student’s award, we can provide an [award verification letter](/students/support/your-record/award-verification-letter/).

### Delivery time

Orders are usually processed within four to six working days, although it may take up to 10 working days during busy times. We will email you when your certificate has been posted.

Allow approximately two weeks for items to be delivered to UK addresses and one month for overseas addresses. A signature may be required on delivery.

We do not provide duplicate certificates or certify or notarise copies of certificates. The Secretary's Office has information about [certifying copies and notarisation](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/secretary/legal/certifying-documents/).

### My certificate has not arrived

If your replacement certificate has not arrived, email [award-verification@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:award-verification@bristol.ac.uk).
