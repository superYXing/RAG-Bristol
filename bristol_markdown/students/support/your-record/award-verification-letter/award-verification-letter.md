> How to request an award verification letter if you are a former student, higher education institute, government body, employer or another third-party organisation.

## Request a letter

* [Former students](#student)
* [Higher education or government body](#third-party)
* [Other third-party organisations](#third-party)

An award verification letter confirms your qualification and degree classification. It also includes:

* full name
* date of birth (where we hold this information)
* student number (where we hold this information)
* mode of attendance (for example, full-time)
* award title (for example, Economics, History of Art)
* level of award (for example MSc/BSc)
* class (grade) of award (for example, first class, merit)
* start date of study (where we hold this information)
* award date (this is the date the award was confirmed).

A verification letter is not an [academic transcript](/students/support/your-record/transcript/) and does not show marks for individual units.
