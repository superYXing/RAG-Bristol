A transcript is an official document that shows:

* units taken each year and published marks for each unit
* credits for each unit taken in each year of study
* the degree awarded, degree classification and date of award (where applicable)
* glossary to explain any mark signals on the transcript.

It will not show:

* year or programme marks
* an explanation of how every award has been made
* any allowances made for exceptional circumstances.

If you need a personal reference, [contact your personal tutor](/students/support/personal-tutors/) or supervisor.

## Interim transcripts

If you are a current student, you can access and download a digital copy of your interim transcript:

1. [Log in and view](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/assessment-marks) your assessment details
2. Select ‘View interim transcript’
3. Select the programme you wish to view (if applicable)
4. Select ‘Next’

After this, you can:

* print your transcript
  + use your browser's "print" or "share" function. From the dropdown menu, select **Print**.
* save your transcript as a PDF
  + select **Save as PDF** in the print options. A PDF file will be generated for you to save to your device.
* share a copy of your digital transcript via email.

These tasks are free to complete.

If you do not have a registered status, you can request one by following the same process as described for [former students and additional copies](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/your-record/transcript/#former).

## Final award

When your award is published, you can access and download a digital copy of your final transcript.

You should do this before you graduate because your university access will expire shortly after.

1. [Log in and view](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/assessment-marks) your assessment details.
2. Select  **download transcript**.

Check what faculty you are in by looking in [StudentInfo](https://www.bris.ac.uk/studentinfo/).

If you require a copy of your final transcript after your access has expired, submit a request as a former student.

## Former students and additional copies

Visit [the online shop](https://shop.bris.ac.uk/product-catalogue/transcripts) to select the correct transcript for your faculty and level or study.

 If you are not sure which faculty you were in, [check the contacts page](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/help/#school).

## Cost

The cost of a transcript varies depending on:

* graduation date, and
* how many times you have requested a transcript before.

## Assessments during 2019/20 academic year

If your assessments were withdrawn, or you were unable to complete them all due to coronavirus, your transcript may show a mark of zero. There will also be a signal to show that credit was awarded or that you passed the unit.

The zero mark indicates a missing mark, rather than a true zero.
