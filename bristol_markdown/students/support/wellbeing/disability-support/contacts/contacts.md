## Tell us about a disability

If you want to tell us about a disability, you can do so by [requesting a study support plan](/students/support/disability-support/tell-us/). If you need advice from a Disability Adviser or want to know more about support we may be able to provide, you can book an appointment using the contact details below.

## Check that your study support is in place

If you have course-related questions or would like confirmation that your study support plan is in place, contact your [School Disability Coordinator](/students/support/disability-support/contacts/school-disability-coordinator/). Once set up, you support will be in place for the duration of your course.

## Help with DSA applications

We run a workshop on applying for Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA). This is the best way to get help with your application.
