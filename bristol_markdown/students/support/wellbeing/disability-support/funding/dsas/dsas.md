> Disabled Students’ Allowances (DSAs) can cover some of the extra costs you may have during your studies because of a disability.

DSAs are grants only available to UK home students. It is not a means tested fund and they do not have to be repaid.

DSAs may fund:

* one-to-one support such as study skills tuition and specialist mentoring
* specialist equipment and software
* travel costs
* printing costs.

We advise all UK home students with disabilities to apply for DSAs at the same time as applying to university. Do not delay or your support may not be ready for when you start.

## Apply for DSAs

You may be able to apply for DSA online, but this will depend on the funding body you are applying to.

Our [Applying for DSAs workshop](/students/support/disability-support/study-support/workshops/) offers guidance and support to help you with your application.

The [ThisStudentNeeds](https://www.thisstudentneeds.co.uk/)website also provides helpful information on DSA and the application process.
