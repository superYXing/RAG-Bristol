> The Student Counselling Service is an organisational member of the British Association for Counsellors and Psychotherapists (BACP). This means we must abide by the BACP Ethical Framework for the counselling professions and BACP membership policies and protocols.

## Who this statement covers

This statement covers all services that the Student Counselling Service provides to students and staff. Confidentiality applies to students as clients of the service and not to parents or third parties who may contact the service.

All administrative staff and any external consultants who provide us with services are also obliged to comply with this statement.

### Students in groups

Students within groups should also protect the confidentiality of groups members, by not sharing any information disclosed by another member of the group or personal details such as name, course, level of study or any other information that may lead to the student being identified. It is the counsellor's role to ensure students understand group confidentiality principles.

## How we gain consent to process your data

The Student Counselling Service gathers your consent when you attend your first appointment. We encourage you to read the working agreement and consent form before attending your first appointment.

[Read the working agreement and consent form](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/request-support/services/counselling/privacy/consent/)

Consent for your data to be processed when you complete a [Request wellbeing support form](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/request-support/), is gathered by Student Services, which has its own [confidentiality policy](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/policies/student-services-confidentiality-statement/) that also explains exceptions and limitations to confidentiality.

This statement is specific to the Student Counselling Service, and applies in addition to the Student Services confidentiality policy.

## How to register with the service

You may be referred to the Student Counselling Service when you complete a [Request wellbeing support form](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/request-support/) or when you call [+44 (0)117 456 9860](tel:01174569860 "tel:01174569860") (9 am to 5 pm Monday to Friday) to request support. The service will then contact you to register.

## Your first appointment

As part of the first appointment, you will:

* confirm you have read the counselling confidentiality statement
* establish the limits of confidentiality
* have the opportunity to update consent to liaise with other services including opt-in
* sign the working agreement

You can decline and update consent to liaise at any stage, but this may affect the support we can offer. We advise you to explore and discuss consent during your initial appointment.

## Limitations to privacy and confidentiality

Student Counselling Service abide by the Student Agreement and the Data Protection Policy.

Information given by the student to the service will be treated as confidential; there are limits to confidentiality.

The Student Counselling Service will breach confidentiality if there is an imminent risk of harm to self and others (to protect your vital interests or those of another person), including children and vulnerable adults, and in the event of significant illegal activities.

The Student Counselling Service will follow the Mental Ill Health Emergency Response Protocol, the Student Emergency Contact Procedure, and the Opt-In Procedure when the risk and potential for harm is deemed great enough. The Student Counselling Service will always try to inform you if they are going to breach confidentiality, although this may not always be possible.

In these situations, the Student Counselling Service may have to breach confidentiality with the following (this list is not exhaustive):

* Parents
* Concerned friends
* Courts (release of notes)
* Coroners
* Academic departments
* Other student support services
* NHS
* Counter-terrorism (via prevent duty)

## Emergency contact and opt-in

The University has an ‘opt-in’ policy regarding contacting an emergency contact if you are having a mental health crisis.

If you have consented for your emergency contact to be informed the Student Counselling Service will inform the Student Wellbeing Service, or Resident life Service so they can implement this policy.

You may request that an alternative contact is informed (not your emergency contact) if you are having a mental health crisis; you must inform the Student Counselling Service of this alternative contact, and this change will only be applicable to the Student Counselling Service. This should be confirmed with you by your counsellor in your first session and you can change this at any point by informing your counsellor or contacting the Student Counselling Service.

If you have not consented to ‘opt in’ or changed your mind, the Student Counselling Service (Student Counselling Service) will follow their internal management of risk policy and the [Student Emergency Contact Procedure](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/policies/emergency-contact/) in emergency situations.

Parents may also raise concerns directly with the University of Bristol and the Student Counselling Service via the [Report and Support](https://reportandsupport.bristol.ac.uk/) tool.

## Complaints

If you’re not happy with the serv[i](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/complaints/)ce you have received, first talk to the member of staff you have been receiving support from and seek Early Resolution as per the [Student Complaints Procedure](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/complaints/).

If this is not possible, or if you feel the issue has not been resolved, email the Student Counselling Service at [student-counselling@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:student-counselling@bristol.ac.uk), stating:

* that you would like to raise a complaint,
* and who the complaint is about.

This is so we can direct the problem to the right person.

If you are unable to approach the Student Counselling Service with your complaint, you can follow the [Student Complaints Procedure](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/complaints/ "https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/complaints/") in full.

## Evidence for extenuating circumstances
