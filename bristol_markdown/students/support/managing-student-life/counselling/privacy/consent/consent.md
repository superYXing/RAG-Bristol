## Student Counselling Service working agreement

Having registered with the Student Counselling Service (SCS),

I agree to give 48 hours’ notice where possible should I wish to cancel any appointments or group sessions offered by contacting the office by phone [+44 (0)117 394 0123](tel:01173940123 "+44 (0)117 394 0123") or email: [student-counselling@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:student-counselling@bristol.ac.uk "student-counselling@bristol.ac.uk").

I understand that:

* I can work together with SCS staff in choosing individual counselling, group therapy or Mental Health Advisory Service support and reviewing what is appropriate to my needs.
* SCS provides short term therapeutic interventions. For One At A Time sessions, I can access support until the end of the academic year. SCS will complete reviews at six sessions and signpost me if necessary to appropriate services.
* To book a further One At A Time appointment I should first reflect on the session. If I require further support, I need to wait a minimum of 24 hours to make an appointment.
* SCS works according to the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy’s Ethical Framework.
* SCS will always contact me if for any reason my session needs to be cancelled or re-arranged.
* If I have any concerns about the counselling, I have received I should raise this with my counsellor/mental health adviser or group facilitator in the first instance and then, if necessary, with the Head of Service by email to student-counselling@bristol.ac.uk
* I agree to give 48 hours notice to the service if I need to cancel a session. I understand that short notice cancellations/non attended appointments might come out of my total allocated sessions or impact the support available that is to me.
* In the event I do not attend without notice, SCS may also contact me by phone, email and/or text to check in. I will update SCS if I do not want to be contacted by phone or text.
