#### If you are new to student counselling

[Book a wellbeing appointment.](/students/support/managing-student-life/book-an-appointment/)

When you [book a wellbeing appointment](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/managing-student-life/book-an-appointment/) our wellbeing advisers will direct you to the most suitable support or service. Where appropriate, wellbeing advisers may refer you for counselling support.

## Counselling sessions

If you are referred to counselling, we will email you the details of your first appointment.

We predominantly use the one-at-a-time (OAAT) model. One at a time is a short-term counselling model that gives you the flexibility to ask for counselling when you need it most.

Find out more about the one-at-a-time model [in our short YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=78&v=T6N2aH1cBro&feature=youtu.be).

## Support needs and preferences

If you have any specific access needs, you can contact us to advise us about these and we will organise sessions to meet these needs where possible.

We have a diverse range of identities within [the Student Counselling Service team](/students/support/managing-student-life/counselling/our-counsellors/). If you want support from a counsellor with a specific identity, such as gender or ethnicity, please contact us to request this once you have been referred.

## Counselling with Nilaari

Nilaari is a community-based counselling charity. If we are unable to provide a counsellor that represents your needs (for example, certain ethnicity or language), [Nilaari may be able to help](https://www.nilaari.co.uk/). Contact them on [+44 (0)117 952 5742](tel:01179525742) for up to six free counselling sessions.
