If you want to search by subject, you can do so via our Year/Semester abroad pages. These list all of our partners but are aimed at Study Abroad students. This table also allows you to search by country,if you know where in the world you would like to go to.\n\nYou will need to cover the cost of attending a summer school which can vary depending on the host institution and location. Make sure you look into the application, tuition and accommodation costs before you apply. Some universities will also help with your visa application and will include the cost of this in the application.  \nMake sure you check the university's refund policy, as they can vary enormously. Not all will be able to refund you if you change your mind and can no longer go.\n\nMany summer schools will offer campus accommodation, and others will provide guidance on finding your own private accommodation. Check whether accommodation is available at the host university or if you need to find your own.\n\nEligibility criteria and the application process will vary between summer schools. Remember to check each summer school's application process and deadline.You will need to apply directly to the host institution, not to the University of Bristol. Generally you would need to apply as a \"fee paying\" or independent student.\n\nYou will often receive a certificate of participation and a summer school is a great way to develop your skills and knowledge. Your host university may award you credits for taking part in the summer school but you will not be able to transfer these back to your Bristol degree course. Anecdotally we know some students plan to use these for future graduate programmes which may require credits they are not able to gain at Bristol.",

The first 2 weeks in the jungle was something I had never experienced before, sleeping in tenets, no wifi, bucket showers. However they kept us very busy with helping the organisation carry out research on different parts of their project in the morning, afternoon and sometimes evening. We had lectures during the day where we learnt more about the biodiversity around where we were staying. On the first Friday we went to visit some local Mayan Ruins which were really cool! We shared tents with the other students that were staying there - 2 per tent. In our spare time I would play cards with other students and it was a great time to bond. In the last 2 weeks I moved to the marine site at the coast, which was amazing. We learnt and got qualified to dive in small groups, and in the second week helped assist with their research as we were now qualified. We collected coral and fish ID data and one day we even got to help clean a coral nursery - teamed up with a local coral restoration project. On our last weekend we got to visit a local mangrove which was so nice! Overall the whole trip I learned some really good skills, for myself and for future jobs if I want to enter into conservation, and got to see so many cool animals and biodiversity!”  \n- Sicely Francis, Operation Wallacea participant, summer 2025",

Your Programme Manager at Intern Abroad HQ will match you with a host company based on your past work experience and future career goals.  \n“I went to Rabat, Morocco to do an internship with the women's rights NGO 'Jossour Forum des Femmes Marocaines' as part of the Intern Abroad HQ Human Rights and NGO Support internship programme. From Monday to Friday, we went to the office and worked on various tasks such as creating project proposals, presentations, applying for grants, and translating documents. I lived in a traditional Moroccan riad, sharing a room with two other interns/volunteers. This was a unique experience as I was constantly surrounded by other people and, therefore, felt a strong sense of community. The internship was insightful as it made me aware of the day-to-day activities of an NGO, as well as some of the specific issues Morocco faces regarding gender equality and women's rights. It also challenged me to think creatively regarding possible solutions to these issues. After work, we would explore the city of Rabat, often finding ourselves shopping in the souks or spending time by the beach. On weekends, we would travel to a different city in Morocco in order to make the most of our time abroad. These weekend trips were the highlight of my experience, as I really saw the beauty of Morocco, and realised that travelling is not as daunting as I previously thought.”  \n- Adon Tomas, Intern Abroad HQ participant, summer 2025",

Earn money, explore America, make a difference through Summer Camp, USA.  \n“I went to the US to work at a summer camp - Camp Kinder Ring in upstate New York. Here I worked as a specialist at the adventure centre, ensuring and overseeing the safe climbing of kids up and down the adventure course. I also was a counsellor for a groups of girls aged 14-15. This role was super exciting. The hours are quite long though, you are up from 8am to about 10:30pm and if the kids need you during the night, then you are up as well. We got one day off a week and sometimes they allowed you to leave the evening before. It was extremely tiring but an incredible experience overall. My camp employed people from over 21 countries, allowing me the chance to get to know a very wide variety of people which was an incredible opportunity. Overall I would highly recommend this experience, it allows you to learn a lot about yourself.”  \n- Samantha Nothnagel, BUNAC participant, summer 2025",

Students will work with our academics, community partners and each other to explore important ways of thinking about and engaging with nature within and beyond the context of the city.  \nThey will consider the importance of places and times, materials and objects, stories and narratives as they build an understanding of people’s relationships with the rest of the natural world.  \nStudents’ studies will focus on the interface of city and nature, taking in subjects which may range from geology, wildlife, extinctions, nature on display, eco-literature, and film. They will engage with foundational environmental humanities methodologies, conceptual approaches to the study of human-nature relationships and specific case studies rooted in the histories, cultures, and communities of Bristol.  \nBristol is an ideal case study for this programme: it has parklands, nature reserves, underground rivers, a towering gorge and thriving night-time ecologies.  \nBy the end of their studies, students will have gained a sense of nature’s place in Bristol, the environmental challenges facing our planet and the ways in which the environmental humanities can help us understand and develop new relationships between people and the wider natural world. Students will apply this learning by completing a research project – in the form of a presentation – and investigate how an environmental humanities approach shapes their understanding of Bristol and/or the South West of England.  \nYou can read the course description, aims, intended learning outcomes, and teaching and assessment information in our Unit Catalogue.

If possible, we advise that you visit the UK when looking for accommodation.  \nOur Accommodation Office offers information and guidance on where to look for private accommodation and how to make sure you find a safe place to live by following their housing advice. You can use their Bristol rental areas map to explore the different rental areas along with details about each of these.We also recommend Bristol SU lettings, a lettings agency run by the Students' Union.  \nIf you are living in privately rented accommodation, you will be liable for paying council tax for any dates outside your official university registration.

    "document": "Ashley specialised in Physical and Organic chemistry during the final year of his MSci Chemistry degree and undertook a research project in the field of Soft Matter that involved the evaluation of surfactants with reduced environmental impact, with potential applications as detergents.\n\nThe transferable skills that I developed from my studies which were particularly relevant to my chosen career include: researching topics at a macro and micro scale of detail, being able to concisely summarise large amounts of information, timekeeping and managing deadlines (a hugely important aspect of my work), applying scientific knowledge to tangible inventions and being able to discuss complex concepts in layman's terms. My research project involved collaborating with a small company based in Bristol and that gave me a great idea of what it's like to work with a client.  \nAshley is now a Technical Assistant in the Chemistry & Life Sciences practice group at Gill Jennings & Every LLP and is working towards full qualification as a UK and European Patent Attorney.",

During his time at Bristol, he developed the skills that would successfully integrate him into the financial industry.\n\nDuring my 4 years at Bristol, I had many opportunities to develop my presentation, problem solving and teamwork skills from activities ranging from tutorials to teaching labs. All vital skills required in my current role of management consultant. My placement year in industry provided me with an insight, not only into the world of R&D, but finance, marketing, procurement and supply chain too.\n\nI chose to pursue a career in management consulting owing to the variety of work the role offered. Projects involve operational or financial transformations of businesses from a wide range of industries and sectors. My past projects include providing financial transformations to a large corporate pharmaceutical and developing the NHS Leadership Academy programs. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time so far and have built a large professional network both within the graduate scheme and throughout the company.",

A scholarship from the Royal Society of Chemistry means she had the benefit of extra tuition too.\n\nIt’s been a great experience - passing on my knowledge to the next generation has been so rewarding. My students always ask me about my time at Bristol, and it is great to be able to inspire others to follow in my footsteps. Putting the complicated aspects of Chemistry into language that 11-16 year olds can access has been a challenge at times, and I often find myself repeating the anecdotes and analogies I was told in lectures. Children have so many questions about the world which are often left unanswered, and being able to use my expert knowledge to explain all the phenomena we observe everyday has been extremely gratifying. I would definitely recommend it.",

Subsequently, he remained to study for a PhD under the guidance of Professor Richard Evershed, as a member of the Organic Geochemistry Unit (OGU), developing new molecular methods for characterising organic matter and processes in soils and sediments. He was awarded his doctorate in 1998 and continued in the OGU as a NERC funded postdoctoral researcher studying trophic preferences of soil invertebrates and the uptake of methane by bacteria in soils. The latter resulting in a communication that was published in Nature in 2000. About this time, he became the manager of the Bristol node of the NERC Life Sciences Mass Spectrometry Facility, hosted by the OGU. Remaining in this post, he was promoted to Research Fellow in 2007. In 2019 he became Head of the National Environmental Isotope Facility (NEIF) – Bristol Laboratory and in 2022 was promoted from Research Fellow to Associate Professor of Analytical Chemistry. Ian lives with his wife Claire and, in September 2019 both became parents to a daughter, Laila-Mae. Subsequently in late 2020, during the pandemic, Ian contracted Necrotising fasciitis which he fortunately survived although it did result in the amputation of his left hand. He returned to full-time work after a four-month period of recovery and continues as an active academic lead in the OGU. He conducts research and teaches in the fields of Archaeological Chemistry, Biogeochemistry and Environmental Chemistry as well as delivering more general analytical chemistry as part of the core units of the Chemistry programmes.  \n\"Laila-Mae was a sudden and unexpected addition to our family. I will never cease to be amazed and grateful for the lengths to which the University went to support us. This ranged from *ad hoc* arrangement of an equivalent to maternity leave for my wife where there was no pre-existing policy in place to arranging for Laila-Mae’s entry into the University Day Nursery at extremely short notice. Even today, neither Claire nor I are sure how we would have coped without the help and understanding of the University.\"  \n\"Returning to work after a major illness is both relieving but also somewhat daunting. The School of Chemistry and, more widely, the University acted above and beyond to ensure that my transition back to work was as smooth and painless as possible. Actions included a phased-return to full-time work, provision of disabled parking and supply of cutting-edge dictation software to compensate for my impaired ability to type. Nowadays, I commonly forget that I have a disability, such is the degree of support that I have received, and I greatly appreciate the normalcy that this has brought back to my working life.\"",

    "document": "“Historically, women have been acutely underrepresented in my field of research – synthetic organic chemistry. The “leaky pipeline” is very evident and as I have progressed through my career I have watched with sadness as the number of women declines at each new stage. While there have always been a handful of brilliant women in senior positions, women whose ground-breaking research has inspired and encouraged me, models of a research career which included raising children were few and far between. For a long time, it wasn’t clear to me whether it was even possible to take time away from leading a research group and the associated fast-paced world of research to raise a child. However, with the support of the University, the School of Chemistry, and my funders, I am proud that over the last year I have built something that works for me, my family, and my research. I took 8 months maternity leave after my daughter was born. During this time, my group were supported by my amazing colleagues, and I was able to use “keeping in touch” days to continue to guide the intellectual direction of our research programme. Our funders were flexible and accommodating and my return to work has been supported by the University’s “Returning Carers’ Scheme” which has given me the required time and space to re-build the research momentum of the group. Ultimately, there is no “right” way of balancing a research career with raising a family or other caring commitments, but I feel that the School of Chemistry has supported me as I have worked out what works for me. As more men take paternity or parental leave, and, as a society, as we increasingly recognise and value the importance of supporting other forms of leave, which may be needed for many reasons, I believe that we will increasingly see that taking periods of leave within our careers will be no barrier to an ambitious and successful research career.”",

    "document": "Chemistry was a radical career change for Professor Simon Hall whose professional life saw him working as a senior bond market analyst with Reuters. In 1997, he switched interests and decided to read for a PhD at the University of Bath with Professor Steve Mann, subsequently moving to Bristol as Professor Mann took up post as Bristol’s Director of the Centre for Organized Matter Chemistry. Professor Hall’s research group is interested in complex functional materials and how, by controlling crystallisation, their functionality can be altered and improved.  \n“It is interesting to me as it gives us all a deeper understanding into how behaviour such as superconductivity, piezoelectricity, magnetoresistance and ferroelectricity can emerge as a function of crystal size and shape. These are all very important physical properties for modern devices.”  \nAs the father of two teenage children, a good work-life balance is important to Professor Hall. The use of online administrative and assessment systems allow academics to work remotely and reserve time for both research and family commitments.  \n“The school has a very positive and inclusive working environment, with an emphasis (quite rightly) on safety at work. There are also plenty of extra-curricular events run by the GCA such as the bake sales, quizzes and charity summer and Christmas parties that engender a strong community spirit within the School.  \n“The working environment overall consists of good communication and great teamwork, and for me,  \nChemistry continues to be a fascinating and enjoyable place in which to work.  \n“My advice to aspiring scientists would be to read widely, discuss your work with everyone and study hard what interests you the most.”",

    "document": "Prof. Matt Rigby studies greenhouse gas sources and sinks using atmospheric data and models. He moved to the School of Chemistry in 2012 as a Natural Environment Research Council research fellow, following a four-year position as a Research Scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA. Previously, he completed a PhD in Atmospheric Physics at Imperial College London, and he studied Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge. Between 2016 and 2019, he took two periods of shared parental leave following the birth of his children.  \n“My wife and I are both academics at the university. It’s challenging balancing two research groups and teaching commitments, with the demands of two energetic kids! When our children were born, the university was very supportive in helping us navigate the complexities of shared parental leave. We both managed to spend a substantial part of our children’s first years at home, whilst keeping things moving at work.”  \n“As the children got older, the flexibility of our roles has been extremely useful. Before the children started school, we both took substantial periods working compressed or reduced hours so that we could look after the children. Now, the university’s flexible working policy helps us ensure there is always someone available for school pick-ups and drop-offs.”  \n“I’ve also been impressed by the willingness of colleagues to support each other. Many courses are now taught by teams of lecturers. This means that there’s usually someone who can step in if something goes wrong. This was especially useful during the pandemic, when we were often stuck at home without childcare at short notice.”",

Several years ago, they needed a radically new snow product that was non-toxic and left no harmful residues. They teamed up with theBriscoe group at the University of Bristol, using their expertise in Soft Matter, to develop new eco-friendly artificial snow products.  \nThese world-leading products have now been used in over 1,200 events since 2017, including dozens of blockbuster Hollywood films, major festivals, shows, and TV programmes. The Briscoe Groupused the Dynamic Foam Analyser to evaluate the stability of the eco-friendly foam, which informed their rational design for the formulations.  \n#### **Altering UK Government guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic**  \nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, University of Bristol researchers measured the concentrations and size distributions of respiratory aerosols generated by performing artists and athletes during breathing, speaking, singing, playing musical instruments, and exercising. The results demonstrated, among other things, that speaking and singing generate similar amounts of aerosol at the same loudness. The results led directly to changes in UK Government guidance in the performing arts in August 2020. Aerodynamic and optical particle sizers were key BACIC instrumentation that facilitated this study.  \n#### **Heads or tails: X-Rays get a grip on why Erucamide slips**  \nThe Diamond Light Source has highlighted a research collaboration between the University of Bristol and Procter & Gamble that offers insights into the surface nanostructure of a slippery industrial additive widespread in industrial applications. Slip additives have a wide range of industrial uses, finding their way into everything from lubricants to healthcare products. Fatty acid amides have been used as slip additives since the 1960s, and erucamide is widely used in polymer manufacturing. However, questions remain regarding the nanostructure of organised erucamide surface layers, including the molecular orientation of the outermost erucamide layer.  \nIn work recently published in the*Journal of Colloid and Interface Science*,PhD student Dajana Gubała in Professor Wuge Briscoe’s group, working with a team from the Diamond Light Source, Procter & Gamble, and Bristol Chemistry, used a combination of techniques including contact angle measurement (with the Droplet Shape Analyzer in BACIC) and synchrotron X-ray reflectivity (XRR) to perform a quantitative characterisation of the structural parameters (e.g. wettability, molecular packing and thickness).",

As part of the Christmas Lecture, a demonstration of respiratory aerosol generation was performed using an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer from BACIC. The Christmas Lectures are the world’s leading science lectures for young people and are watched by millions of people every year.  \n#### **Aerosols and the Black Death**  \nProfessor Jonathan Reid was interviewed for a documentary about how the Black Death may have been spread by aerosols. An Aerodynamic Particle Sizer was key to the visual demonstration of respiratory aerosol generation in the broadcast.  \n#### **Changes to the NHS Infection Control and Prevention Manual**  \nBACIC instrumentation supported the AERATOR study, a collaboration between the University of Bristol and North Bristol NHS Trust that that quantified aerosol emitted during Aerosol Generating Procedures (AGPs). AGPs are medical procedures thought to generate aerosol that may enhance the risk of disease transmission and therefore require additional infection control steps to mitigate this risk. The results from AERATOR demonstrated that many AGPs do not generate aerosol00216-2). AERATOR’s results led to changes in the NHS England Infection Prevention and Control manual in 2022. Aerodynamic and optical particle sizers from BACIC were key instruments that enabled these studies.  \n#### **Surface tensions of aerosols differ from those of bulk solutions**",

    "document": "#### **Surface tensions of aerosols differ from those of bulk solutions**  \nAerosols serve as the seeds for atmospheric cloud droplets, and their surface tension plays an important role in determining whether ambient particles will ultimately grow into cloud droplets. However, the surface composition of aerosols is poorly understood. Bristol researchers measured directly the surface tensions of surfactant-containing droplets and compared these to macroscopic solution measurements made with the Krüss K100 tensiometer. The results demonstrated that the surface tensions of surfactant-containing droplets may not match those of the solutions from which they were generated, challenging key assumptions underlying climate models.",

    "document": "> Professor Adrian Mulholland, Dr Tom Oliver and Dr Sofia Oliveira from the School of Chemistry have been awarded a 5-year £4.9 m Strategic Longer and Larger (sLoLa) grant by BBSRC entitled “Creating and comprehending the circuitry of life: precise biomolecular design of multi-centre redox enzymes for a synthetic metabolism”.  \n6 April 2022  \nThe grant is led by Dr Ross Anderson (Bristol Biochemistry) and brings together researchers from Bristol Chemistry and Biochemistry, Portsmouth, UEA and UCL.  \nThe flow of electrons and capture of solar energy within protein-based molecular wires and circuitry is essential to all life on Earth, and underpin important processes such as photosynthesis and cellular respiration. The ‘design principles’ of exquisite natural nanoscale biomolecular electron and energy conducting circuits are not understood and so have not been utilised. The project will unlock this potential, and create new modular *de novo* proteins capable of acting as efficient biomolecular circuits for broadband light-harvesting, long-range electron/energy transfer, and catalysis. This will ultimately lead to tailor-made catalysts for green industrial biotechnology or tuneable biocompatible protein-based solar panels. Integrating these artificial biological circuits into cells may also provide new routes to biosensors, useful for diagnosis and treatment of a range of diseases.  \nMulholland and Oliveira will use state-of-the art computational methods and virtual reality tools to design new proteins with atomic-level precision and tailor their redox properties by tuning the energetic landscape to funnel energy and/or electron transfer in specific directions.  \nOliver will establish a unique and world-leading laser system at Bristol to unravel the long-range flow of energy and charge on timescales spanning femtoseconds-to-milliseconds. The experiments will provide molecular-level mechanistic insights into the directionality and efficiency of the desired energy and charge transfer processes within individual and arrays of *de novo* proteins.",

    "document": "> Dr Chris Adams was born sometime before computers and the internet were in common use, and he died on Sunday, 25th September 2022, leaving behind his family, friends and our community of colleagues and students in the School of Chemistry.  \n1 December 2022  \nIn the years in-between these key dates, he became a husband, father, accomplished coordination chemist, sympathetic teacher, enthusiastic piano player, a stoic cricket batsman, keen cyclist, as well as a key driver behind the introduction of active learning techniques and a student-focussed new curriculum.  \nHe also introduced the school to Robert and Susan, Biggs’s model student characters (John Biggs (1999)) and his comment “but that’s because you are “a Susan”, now think about how we engage with the Roberts” will stay with us for a while yet.  \nHis own anecdotes as told annually to new students suggest that Chris turned himself from an underachieving and disinterested second year undergraduate (Robert) at the University of Cambridge into a keen and engaged finalist (Susan), insinuating himself into the experiments of his future colleague, one Chris Russell, then a PhD student at the same institution. Adams’s experiences during his own studies continued to inform his teaching practices and many past and present students have highlighted his patience and support, especially when they found their initial brush with our teaching lab experience challenging and daunting.",

    "document": "Back to young Adams at Corpus Christi college, who progressed to a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry at Cambridge, working in the group of Paul Raithby. It was Cambridge where he met his future wife, Claire Rice, who he married in 2000, while also studying the transition metal complexes of acetylide ligands. Chris joined the University of Bristol around the same time, first as part of Neil Connelly’s and then Guy Orpen’s groups, where he balanced his teaching commitments and research interests – his direct style was evident from the beginning, with him asking the question “what colour is it?” becoming inextricably and traumatically linked to every Structure of the Week presentation. He solved many crystal structures, often with Tiggerish-glee as the correct complex emerged on the computer screen during the refinement, and was involved in the synthesis and characterisation of coordination complexes across a considerable number of projects and collaborations, as well as attending Bristol City Football matches with his friend and colleague, Jonathan (Charlie) Charmant. Having just moved into the family home and, like most chemists, liking a bit of cooking, he was also an enthusiastic host to many friends and colleagues. He was well known on the University’s cricket circuit, captaining the UoB staff second team through many matches in the Bristol and City local league and bringing a touch of the classic style to the game as a great all-rounder, together with Avinash Patil and colleagues from other departments, and often supported by his young kids.  \nChris was appointed to a lectureship in 2006 and secured independent research funding through the First Grant Scheme to pursue transition metal complexes for quantum computing in 2007. This allowed him to recruit a PhD student and a postdoctoral researcher and, for a while, his research flourished. He taught himself how to run the departmental EPR instruments, alongside building collaborations to achieve the characterisation of the complexes made. (The complexes were mostly purple and brown, in case you are wondering.) Chris took a career break in 2010 to focus on his young children, Rachael and Ben, as well as growing rhubarb on his allotment and improving his piano playing.  \nHe couldn’t stay away from the labs of the School of Chemistry for long, though, and joined again as a Teaching Lab Fellow in 2011, initially part-time, shifting his focus to supporting the teaching labs and perfecting his knowledge and practice of chemistry education. Whether for research or teaching, the labs were always his happy place, and he could often be found developing and perfecting a new process or activity. All the better if he could combine this with sharing his obvious pride at the achievements of his wife and children (with anybody who would listen, really, but especially his colleagues sharing the same office at the back of the teaching labs, which included Jenny Slaughter, Karen Parrish, Ben Baker and Rob Thatcher).",

    "document": "It would be remiss of us to not mention his everyday superpower, making every outfit look crumpled by the time he arrived at work (or it might have been the labcoat worn over his clothes most days). Chemistry Balls showed that he scrubbed up well enough in a suit, he accompanied his weekly ironing with the much-loved question of “what is Chris listening to while he’s ironing” on Facebook, and many a skater was instructed to hoik up their trousers before coming to the lab to protect their otherwise bare midriffs, but the fame of Dek Woolfson’s snappy shirts continued to elude him.  \nChris’s approach to taking on a new course became tried and tested – for the first year, he’d run with what was there, learning all the details and identifying the problematic areas, while reading extensively around the field and identifying cutting-edge educational and research practices. In the next year, he would begin making changes, using evidence-based approaches to gradually transition each unit and lab course he was involved with towards a more student-centric, skills-focussed and effective approach, considering not just the manual handling skills, but also a forward-looking approach to data handling and analysis. His impact on the delivery of the first year labs, introducing a skills unit and embedding the teaching of skills, as he described in a key paper. This played a role in how his colleagues ended up learning about Robert and Susan, after Chris had aced the CREATE course and became a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy in 2019, from where he progressed to Senior Fellow in 2021.  \nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic required a rapid pivot towards online teaching, Chris, by then a master at herding cats and deeply familiar with Chemistry’s virtual learning environment, produced instructions and videos to help and support his colleagues in a transition he had already implemented for his own teaching. He was also instrumental in constructing the first year of the new curriculum, steering his colleagues through significant changes in regular meetings, with gentle persistence, hot beverages, and always leading by example. These achievements were recognised in multiple nominations for Bristol Teaching Awards, and he won the award for Innovative Teaching in the Faculty of Science in June 2022, as well as being one of the nominees for the best portfolio award for his SFHEA work in the same round.  \nWith his kids pursuing their own interests as they became older, Chris found time for cycling and walking at the weekend, and he was known to show up at colleagues’ houses unexpectedly, unknowingly triggering them to scurryfunge, when all he wanted was a short pitstop with a cup of tea and a cheese sandwich, before continuing on his way for what was easily a 20 mile walk or a 50 mile cycle ride, posting pictures on social media as he went.",

    "document": "> Vigorous exercise does not produce significantly more respiratory particles than speaking, but high-intensity exercise does, finds new University of Bristol-led research. The study, published in Communications Medicine, is the first to measure exhaled aerosols generated during exercise, to help inform the risk of airborne viral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for indoor exercise facilities and sporting and physical group activities.  \n19 April 2022  \nTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 is considered to occur predominantly by inhalation of infectious aerosol. In the first published study of its kind, a UK-wide collaborative team of clinicians and researchers conducted a series of experiments to measure the size and concentration of exhaled particles (up to 20 µm diameter) which are generated in our respiratory tracts and breathed out, during vigorous and high-intensity exercise.  \nUsing a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), 25 healthy participants comprising 13 males and 12 females with a range of athletic abilities, were recruited to undertake four different activities (breathing at rest, speaking at normal conversational volume, vigorous exercise and high-intensity exercise) on a cycle ergometer. The participants breathed into a specially adapted mask which measured airflow and transmitted any particles emitted from their mouth and nose to a particle counter. Experiments were carried out in an orthopaedic operating theatre — an environment of “zero aerosol background”, which allowed the researchers to unambiguously identify the aerosols generated by the participants.  \nThe team found that the size of airborne particles emitted during vigorous exercise was consistent with that of a person breathing at rest. However, the rate at which individuals exhale aerosol mass during vigorous exercise was found to be similar to speaking at a conversational volume.  \nJonathan Reid, Director ofESPRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Aerosol Scienceand Professor of Physical Chemistry in theSchool of Chemistryat the University of Bristol and scientific lead on the paper, said: “COVID-19 has profoundly impacted sports and exercise, and this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the mass emission rates of aerosol that can potentially carry infectious virus produced from an individual during exercise. Our research has shown that the likely amount of virus that someone can exhale in small aerosol particles when exercising is comparable to when someone speaks at a conversational volume. The most effective way to reduce risk is to ensure spaces are appropriately ventilated to reduce the risk of airborne transmission.”",

    "document": "> SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals could have different variants hidden in different parts of the body.  \n6 April 2022  \nPeople suffering from COVID-19 could have several different SARS-CoV-2 variants hidden away from the immune system in different parts of the body, finds new research published in*Nature Communications*by an international research team. The study’s authors say that this may make complete clearance of the virus from the body of an infected person, by their own antibodies, or by therapeutic antibody treatments, much more difficult.  \nCOVID-19 continues to sweep the globe causing hospitalisations and deaths, damaging communities and economies worldwide. Successive variants of concern (VoC), replaced the original virus from Wuhan, increasingly escaping immune protection offered by vaccination or antibody treatments.  \nIn new research, comprising two studies published in parallel in*Nature Communications*, an international team led byProfessor Imre Bergerat the University of Bristol andProfessor Joachim Spatzat the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg , both Directors of theMax Planck Bristol Centre of Minimal Biology, show how the virus can evolve distinctly in different cell types, and adapt its immunity, in the same infected host.  \nThe team sought to investigate the function of a tailor-made pocket in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the infection cycle of the virus. The pocket, discovered by the Bristol team in anearlier breakthrough, played an essential role in viral infectivity.  \n“An incessant series of variants have completely replaced the original virus by now, with Omicron and Omicron 2 dominating worldwide.” said Professor Imre Berger. “We analysed an early variant discovered in Bristol, BrisDelta. It had changed its shape from the original virus, but the pocket we had discovered was there, unaltered”. Intriguingly, BrisDelta, presents as a small subpopulation in the samples taken from patients, but appears to infect certain cell-types better than the virus that dominated the first wave of infections.  \nDr Kapil Gupta, lead author of the BrisDelta study, explains: “Our results showed that one can have several different virus variants in one’s body. Some of these variants may use kidney or spleen cells as their niche to hide, while the body is busy defending against the dominant virus type. This could make it difficult for the infected patients to get rid of SARS-CoV-2 entirely.”  \nThe team applied cutting-edge synthetic biology techniques, state-of-the-art imaging and cloud computing to decipher viral mechanisms at work. To understand the function of the pocket, the scientists built synthetic SARS-CoV-2 virions in the test tube, that are mimics of the virus but have a major advantage in that they are safe, as they do not multiply in human cells.",

To understand the function of the pocket, the scientists built synthetic SARS-CoV-2 virions in the test tube, that are mimics of the virus but have a major advantage in that they are safe, as they do not multiply in human cells.  \nUsing these artificial virions, they were able to study the exact mechanism of the pocket in viral infection. They demonstrated that upon binding of a fatty acid, the spike protein decorating the virions changed their shape. This switching ‘shape’ mechanism effectively cloaks the virus from the immune system.  \nDr Oskar Staufer, lead author of this study and joint member of the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg and the Max Planck Centre in Bristol, explains: “By ‘ducking down’ of the spike protein upon binding of inflammatory fatty acids, the virus becomes less visible to the immune system. This could be a mechanism to avoid detection by the host and a strong immune response for a longer period of time and increase total infection efficiency.”  \n“It appears that this pocket, specifically built to recognise these fatty acids, gives SARS-CoV-2 an advantage inside the body of infected people, allowing it to multiply so fast. This could explain why it is there, in all variants, including Omicron” added Professor Berger. “Intriguingly, the same feature also provides us with a unique opportunity to defeat the virus, exactly because it is so conserved - with a tailormade antiviral molecule that blocks the pocket.”Halo Therapeutics, a recent University of Bristol spin-out founded by the authors, pursues exactly this approach to develop pocket-binding pan-coronavirus antivirals.  \nThe team included experts fromBristol UNCOVER Group, theMax Planck Institute for Medical Researchin Heidelberg, Germany, Bristol University spin-outHalo Therapeutics Ltdand further collaborators in UK and in Germany.

    "document": "> Prehistoric people in Europe were consuming milk thousands of years before humans evolved the genetic trait allowing us to digest the milk sugar lactose as adults, finds a new study. The research, published in Nature, mapped pre-historic patterns of milk use over the last 9,000 years, offering new insights into milk consumption and the evolution of lactose tolerance.  \n28 July 2022  \nUntil now, it was widely assumed that lactose tolerance emerged because it allowed people to consume more milk and dairy products. But this new research, led by scientists from the University of Bristol andUniversity College London (UCL)alongside collaborators from 20 other countries, shows that famine and exposure to infectious disease best explains the evolution of our ability to consume milk and other non-fermented dairy products.  \nWhile most European adults today can drink milk without discomfort, two thirds of adults in the world today, and almost all adults 5,000 years ago, can face problems if they drink too much milk. This is because milk contains lactose, and if we don’t digest this unique sugar, it will travel to our large intestine where it can cause cramps, diarrhoea, and flatulence; known as lactose intolerance. However, this new research suggests that in the UK today these effects are rare.  \nProfessor George Davey Smith, Director of theMRC Integrative Epidemiology Unitat the University of Bristol and a co-author of the study, said: “To digest lactose we need to produce the enzyme lactase in our gut. Almost all babies produce lactase, but in the majority of people globally that production declines rapidly between weaning and adolescence. However, a genetic trait called lactase persistence has evolved multiple times over the last 10,000 years and spread in various milk-drinking populations in Europe, central and southern Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Today, around one third of adults in the world are lactase persistent.”  \nBy mapping patterns of milk use over the last 9,000 years, probing the UK Biobank, and combining ancient DNA, radiocarbon, and archaeological data using new computer modelling techniques, the team were able to show that lactase persistence genetic trait was not common until around1,000BC, nearly4,000years after it was first detected around 4,700–4,600 BC.  \n“The lactase persistence genetic variant was pushed to high frequency by some sort of turbocharged natural selection. The problem is, such strong natural selection is hard to explain,” addedProfessor Mark Thomas, Professor of Evolutionary Geneticsand study co-author from University College London.",

The problem is, such strong natural selection is hard to explain,” addedProfessor Mark Thomas, Professor of Evolutionary Geneticsand study co-author from University College London.  \nIn order to establish how lactose persistence evolved,Professor Richard Evershed, the study’s lead fromBristol’s School of Chemistry, assembled an unprecedented database of nearly 7,000 organic animal fat residues from 13,181 fragments of pottery from 554 archaeological sites to find out where and when people were consuming milk. His findings showed milk was used extensively in European prehistory, dating from the earliest farming nearly 9,000 years ago, but increased and decreased in different regions at different times.  \nTo understand how this relates to the evolution of lactase persistence, the UCL team, led by Professor Mark Thomas, assembled a database of the presence or absence of the lactase persistence genetic variant using published ancient DNA sequences from more than 1,700 prehistoric European and Asian individuals. They first saw it after around 5,000 years ago. By 3,000 years ago it was at appreciable frequencies and is very common today. Next, his team developed a new statistical approach to examine how well changes in milk use through time explain the natural selection for lactase persistence. Surprisingly, they found no relationship, even though they were able to show they could detect that relationship if it existed, challenging the long-held view the extent of milk use drove lactase persistence evolution.  \nProfessor George Davey Smith’s team had been probing theUK Biobank data, comprising genetic and medical data for more than 300,000 living individuals, found only minimal differences in milk drinking behaviour between genetically lactase persistent and non-persistent people. Critically, the large majority of people who were genetically lactase non-persistent experienced no short or long-term negative health effects when they consume milk.  \nProfessor Davey Smith added: “Our findings show milk use was widespread in Europe for at least 9,000 years, and healthy humans, even those who are not lactase persistent, could happily consume milk without getting ill. However, drinking milk in lactase non-persistent individuals does lead to a high concentration of lactose in the intestine, which can draw fluid into the colon, and dehydration can result when this is combined with diarrhoeal disease”.",

He commented: “If you are healthy and lactase non-persistent, and you drink lots of milk, you may experience some discomfort, but you not going to die of it. However, if you are severely malnourished and have diarrhoea, then you’ve got life-threatening problems. When their crops failed, prehistoric people would have been more likely to consume unfermented high-lactose milk – exactly when they shouldn’t.”  \nTo test these ideas, Professor Thomas’ team applied indicators of past famine and pathogen exposure into their statistical models. Their results clearly supported both explanations – the lactase persistence gene variant was under stronger natural selection when there were indications of more famine and more pathogens.  \nThe authors concluded: “Our study demonstrates how, in later prehistory, as populations and settlement sizes grew, human health would have been increasingly impacted by poor sanitation and increasing diarrhoeal diseases, especially those of animal origin. Under these conditions consuming milk would have resulted in increasing death rates, with individuals lacking lactase persistence being especially vulnerable. This situation would have been further exacerbated under famine conditions, when disease and malnutrition rates are increased. This would lead to individuals who did not carry a copy of the lactase persistence gene variant being more likely to die before or during their reproductive years, which would push the population prevalence of lactase persistence up.  \n“It seems the same factors that influence human mortality today drove the evolution of this amazing gene through prehistory.”  \nThe study was supported by funding from theRoyal Society, theRCUK-Medical Research Council (MRC)andNatural Environment Research Council (NERC), and theEuropean Research Council.  \n##### Further information  \nPaper  \n‘Dairying, diseases and the evolution of lactase persistence in Europe’by R Evershed et al in*Nature*.",

His teamdiscovered a druggable pocketin the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein that could be used to stop the virus from infecting human cells, blocking transmission and forestalling severe COVID-19 disease. At the height of the pandemic, his team showed that exposing the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus to a free fatty acid called linoleic acid locks the Spike protein into a closed, non-infective form inhibiting the virus’ ability to enter and multiply in cells, stopping it in its tracks.  \nThe findings, published in*Science*, are now being used to develop new cost-effective treatments against all pathogenic coronavirus strains by Bristol-basedHalo Therapeutics Ltd. The biotech company,co-founded by Professor Berger, is currently preparing for in-human clinical trials.  \nOther notable breakthroughs include the discovery that SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals could haveseveral different SARS-CoV-2 variantshidden away from the immune system in different parts of the body, which may make complete clearance of the virus from infected persons, by their own antibodies, or by therapeutic antibody treatments, much more difficult.  \nProfessor Berger is also pioneering new vaccine technologies. His team developed the ADDomer™, a thermostable vaccine platform for highly adaptable, easy-to-manufacture, rapid-response vaccines to combat present and future infectious diseases including COVID-19. A key benefit of the platform is the speed with which candidate vaccines can be identified and could be manufactured in large quantities without refrigeration, significantly facilitating distribution world-wide. Vaccine innovator start-upImophoron Ltd, co-founded by Professor Berger, is bringing ADDomer™-based vaccines to the market.  \nProfessor Imre Berger said: “I am honoured to have been elected to the Fellowship of the Academy of Medical Sciences.",

    "document": "> The SARS-CoV-2 virus can lose 90% of infectivity when in aerosol particles within 20 minutes, according to new University of Bristol findings. The study, published in the journal of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), is the first to investigate the decrease in infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol particles over periods from seconds to a few minutes. The aim of the study was to explore the process that could change viral infectivity over short timescales following exhalation.  \n28 June 2022  \nScientists from Bristol’s Schools ofChemistry,Vet SchoolandCellular and Molecular Medicine, sought to gain a detailed understanding of the factors which regulate the survival of airborne SARS-CoV-2 inhalable particles, and how infectivity is affected by environmental conditions such as relative humidity (RH) and temperature. RH measures how much water vapour (moisture) there is in the air compared to how much there could be at that temperature. Ideally, healthy indoor RH levels are between 40 to 60%.  \nUsing a novel instrument called CELEBS (ControlledElectrodynamicLevitation andExtraction ofBioaerosols onto aSubstrate), the team were able to probe the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory generated airborne particles and examine how temperature and humidity drive changes in infectivity, from timescales spanning five seconds to 20 minutes. The same experiment was carried out comparing four different SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Alpha and Beta.  \nResults from the team’s experiments found a significant loss in infectivity within the first ten minutes of aerosol particle generation that is strongly dependent on the environmental relative humidity, but not temperature. This effect did not alter across the different SARS-CoV-2 variants.  \nThe team observed a decrease in airborne infectivity at low relative humidity (<50%) that occurs almost immediately, falling to 50% within ten seconds of aerosol generation. This loss occurs when the airborne particles dry and rapidly lose moisture, forming a solid particle. At high relative humidity, the loss in infectivity following aerosolization is more gradual, with a steady loss of infectivity of 50% within the first five minutes and 90% within twenty minutes. This loss is due to a significant increase in aerosol particle pH.  \nJonathan Reid, the study's lead author, Director ofBristol Aerosol Research Centreand Professor of Physical Chemistry in theSchool of Chemistryat the University of Bristol, said: \"We know that aerosol particles, exhaled when infected individuals breathe, speak or cough, can transmit viruses. Understanding the mechanisms that influence the survival of pathogens while airborne is a further piece of the jigsaw puzzle in understanding the spread of diseases such as COVID-19.",

    "document": "> A team of scientists, led by the School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, in co-operation with colleagues from Goethe University, Frankfurt, has uncovered the first insights into the origins of West African plant-based cuisine, locked inside pottery fragments dating back some 3,500 years ago.  \n17 January 2022  \nWest African cuisine has long been known for its distinct ingredients and flavours, often enhanced by the addition of a large and diverse range of plant foods.  \nA traditional meal comprises a starchy staple cooked in a pot, served with a sauce prepared from vegetables, fish and/or meat, often accompanied by pulses.  \nThese starchy staples include root crops such as yams, cassava, sorghum, pearl millet and maize. In the northern Sahel and savanna zones, pearl millet is mainly prepared as porridge, while in the southern forest zone, a pounded mash from tuber crops such as yam, called*fufu*, is the major starch-rich element.  \nIndigenous vegetables, eaten at almost every West African meal, include eggplant,pumpkinand watermelon,okra(used as a thickener for soups and stews), as well as a staggering variety of both farmed and foragedgreen leafy vegetables, little known or used outside of the African continent.  \nThese include leaves from the amaranth, roselle and baobab tree. However, investigating the origin of vegetables and leafy greens is difficult as they do not generally survive over archaeological timescales.  \nThe Bristol team carried out chemical analysis of more than 450 prehistoric potsherds from the Central Nigerian Nok culture to investigate what foods they were cooking in their pots. The Nok people are known for their remarkable large-scale terracotta figurines and early iron production in West Africa, around the first millennium BC.  \nAcidic soils at Nok archaeological sites meant that organic remains such as animal bones and plant remains did not survive very well so what Nok people were eating was somewhat of a mystery. “Charred plant remains like seeds and nutshells preserved in the archaeological sediments reflect only one part of what people consumed in the past”, stated Professor Katharina Neumann from Goethe University, who directed archaeobotanical research on the Nok Project. “We hoped that chemical analyses would provide additional insights into food preparation”.  \nThe researchers used lipid biomarker and stable isotope analyses to show that the largest group of lipid profiles extracted from the ancient pots, over one third, comprised a range of highly diverse and complex distributions denoting the processing of various plant types.  \nDr Julie Dunne, from the University of Bristol’sOrganic Geochemistry Unit, led the research published in the journal*Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences.*She said: “These unusual and highly complex plant lipid profiles are the most varied seen (globally) in archaeological pottery to date.",

    "document": "Dr Julie Dunne, from the University of Bristol’sOrganic Geochemistry Unit, led the research published in the journal*Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences.*She said: “These unusual and highly complex plant lipid profiles are the most varied seen (globally) in archaeological pottery to date.  \n“There appears to be at least seven distinctive lipid profiles within the vessels, providing strong evidence for specialised processing of several plant types (and/or plant organs) in these vessels, likely including leafy plants, grasses, pulses and, possibly, underground storage organs (USOs), confirming, for the first time, the importance of such plants in the Nok diet.”  \nThe team’s results tie in well with ancient plant remains from the site which mainly comprise pearl millet but also cowpea and African peach. Dr Alexa Höhn, a member of the Nok project’s archaeobotanical team in Frankfurt, points out: “The combined evidence of visible and invisible remains of food preparation allows us to gain a much more complete picture of past foodways and the evidence from the Nok culture hints at a considerable time depth for West African cuisine.”  \nWhilst there are few unique lipid biomarkers for leafy plants and cereals and, as such, specific plants consumed by the Nok people, or processed for medicinal purposes, cannot be identified, the results suggest that much of Nok plant consumption included leafy vegetables or ‘greens’, mirroring that of groups living in West Africa today, where these play a significant role in people’s diet.  \nIt seems likely that Nok people consumed ‘greens’ or leaves from plants such as jute mallow, African eggplant, okra, cowpea and bombax, widely used today. These provide cheap but quality nutrition and add taste and flavour to the otherwise monotonous starch-based staples consumed and can be kept dried and stored for use throughout the year, affording a buffer in periods of food shortage.  \nOne of the most important leaf-providing species is the baobab, which, together with species such as okra (*Abelmoschus esculentus*), false sesame, jute mallow and black sesame are today cooked in soups with a little potash (potassium carbonate) to give a high mucilage content or what is known as a ‘slimy’ consistency.  \nThis soup is common in high yam producing areas, likely because pounded yam is known to be complemented by sauces of ‘slimy’ consistency (see image), as are other local cereal and tuber dishes.  \nEvidence for the use of leafy plants can also be found in ethnographic accounts. One of the earliest known mentions of baobab was by Al Bakri in Ghana, writing in 1068, in his great work ‘Kitāb al-Masālik wa-al-Mamālik’ (Book of Highways and of Kingdoms).",

Nachtigal also writes of sauces made from leaves of herbs or trees, mentioning baobab leaves, added with fresh or dried meat, to porridges.  \nThe possible preparation of tubers such as yam, in Nok pots also suggests a long history of use, in good agreement with evidence which suggests a domestication of yams in West Africa at around 2500 BC.  \nDr Dunne added: “In summary, our results demonstrate that prehistoric plant processing and consumption in West Africa involved much more than the cooking of starchy food.  \n“It has allowed us to go beyond the identification of meals thought to consist mainly of meat and starchy plants. We can now confirm, based on the highly diverse range of lipid profiles presented here, the preparation of ancient meals combining vegetables, pulses, USOs and, possibly, herbs/spices.”  \n##### Further information  \n**Paper**  \n‘Making the invisible visible: tracing the origins of plants in West African cuisine through archaeobotanical and organic residue analysis’by J.

    "document": "> Scientists have harnessed the potential of bacteria to help build advanced synthetic cells which mimic real life functionality.  \n14 September 2022  \nThe research, led by the University of Bristol and published today in*Nature*, makes important progress in deploying synthetic cells, known as protocells, to more accurately represent the complex compositions, structure, and function of living cells.  \nEstablishing true-to-life functionality in protocells is a global grand challenge spanning multiple fields, ranging from bottom-up synthetic biology and bioengineering to origin of life research. Previous attempts to model protocells using microcapsules have fallen short, so the team of researchers turned to bacteria to build complex synthetic cells using a living material assembly process.  \nProfessor Stephen Mannfrom the University of Bristol’sSchool of Chemistry, andtheMax Planck Bristol Centre for Minimal Biologytogether with colleagues Drs Can Xu, Nicolas Martin (currently at the University of Bordeaux) and Mei Li in theBristol Centre for Protolife Researchhave demonstrated an approach to the construction of highlycomplex protocells using viscous micro-droplets filled with living bacteria as a microscopic building site.  \nIn the first step, the team exposed the empty droplets to two types of bacteria. One population spontaneously was captured within the droplets while the other was trapped at the droplet surface.  \nThen, both types of bacteria were destroyed so that the released cellular components remained trapped inside or on the surface of the droplets to produce membrane-coated bacteriogenic protocells containing thousands of biological molecules, parts and machinery.  \nThe researchers discovered that theprotocells were able to produce energy-rich molecules (ATP) via glycolysis and synthesize RNA and proteins by in vitro gene expression, indicating that the inherited bacterial components remained active in the synthetic cells.  \nFurther testing the capacity of this technique, the team employed a series of chemical steps to remodel the bacteriogenic protocells structurally and morphologically. The released bacterial DNA was condensed into a single nucleus-like structure, and the droplet interior infiltrated with a cytoskeletal-like network of protein filaments and membrane-bounded water vacuoles.  \nAs a step towards the construction of a synthetic/living cell entity, the researchers implanted living bacteria into the protocells to generate self-sustainable ATP production and long-term energization for glycolysis, gene expression and cytoskeletal assembly. Curiously, the protoliving constructs adopted an amoeba-like external morphology due to on-site bacterial metabolism and growth to produce a cellular bionic system with integrated life-like properties.",

Hopefully, our current bacteriogenic approach will help to increase the complexity of current protocell models, facilitate the integration of myriad biological components and enable the development of energised cytomimetic systems.”  \nFirst author Dr Can Xu, Research Associate at the University of Bristol, added: “Our living-material assembly approach provides an opportunity for the bottom-up construction of symbiotic living/synthetic cell constructs. For example, using engineered bacteria it should be possible to fabricate complex modules for development in diagnostic and therapeutic areas of synthetic biology as well as in biomanufacturing and biotechnology in general.  \n##### Further information  \nPaper  \n*'Living material assembly of bacteriogenic protocells'*byXu C , Martin N , Li M and Mann Sin*Nature.*",

    "document": "> The School of Chemistry is proud to announce that we have been ranked first for research across UK Chemistry Departments in the latest Research Excellence Framework (REF2021).  \n6 June 2022  \nREF is the UK’s system for assessing the quality of research in all UK higher education institutions, and the assessments run every 7 years (the previous REF was held in 2014). In REF2021, 100% of the overall School of Chemistry submission was rated either ‘world leading’ or ‘internationally excellent’.  \nThe Head of the School of Chemistry, Professor Emma Raven, said: “The UK hosts a number of world-leading Schools of Chemistry, all of whom we have enormous respect for. To have been judged, by our peers, as being ahead of all others in this REF is immensely pleasing and humbling. It’s been a huge team effort.”  \n*Real-world scientific impacts*  \nAn important part of the REF process is to demonstrate real-world impacts from research carried out in universities. The Bristol submission thus included a number of impact case studies, show-casing how our work has had wide impact beyond the confines of academia. These case studies included the creation of eco-friendly artificial snow, our contributions to clinical and public health policy on COVID-19 transmission, a multi-million dollar deal for a new diabetes treatment, our input into global decision making on air quality and the recovery of cultural heritage during commercial archaeological investigations.  \nProfessor Adrian Mulholland, the Director of Research, said: “We have embedded a culture that supports the creation of economic, entrepreneurial and societal impact across the School. These activities will help to address global challenges of the future, in health, energy and the environment.”  \n*Collaboration, diversity and collegiality*  \nThe success of our School is built on our academic strength across the whole discipline alongside a pipeline of talent early career researchers and PhD students, many of whom contributed to the REF process.  \nProfessor Craig Butts, who led the REF-submission for the School said: “We pride ourselves on creating a supportive, collaborative and inclusive research culture that supports career development for early career researchers now and into the future. Preparing the REF submission was genuinely an exercise in polishing the diamond that everyone in the School created.”",

    "document": "> Dr Basile Curchod has been named winner of the Royal Society of Chemistry’s Marlow Award in recognition of brilliance in research and innovation.  \n9 June 2022  \nBased at University of Bristol, Dr Curchod won the prize for the development of theoretical and computational methods to unravel new mechanisms in photochemistry. They join a prestigious list of past winners in the RSC’s prize portfolio, 60 of whom have gone on to win Nobel Prizes for their work, including 2016 Nobel laureates Jean-Pierre Sauvage, Fraser Stoddart and Ben Feringa and 2019 Nobel laureate John B Goodenough.  \nDr Curchod also receives £3,000 and a medal.  \nAfter receiving the prize, Dr Curchod said: “I feel honoured and extremely thankful to all the people who contributed to the research awarded by this Prize, from a scientific and support point of view.”  \nDr Curchod’s group at the University of Bristol pursues a wide range of research interests, all aimed at studying how light interacts with molecules, and how the energy gained by the molecule from this interaction can be used to trigger unexpected chemical reactions.  \nThe group uses computers to solve complex equations that describe the physics of light-excited molecules. They develop methods to predict the possible chemical reactions taking place after a molecule absorbs light – known as a photochemical reaction – and apply these methods to study real-world phenomena that involve photochemical processes. A particular focus is predicting how atmospheric molecules may react upon sunlight absorption: a type of information that is often missing in atmospheric models predicting the composition of our atmosphere. By combining theoretical photochemistry and atmospheric chemistry, their research improves the predictive power of atmospheric models in the context of global warming and air quality.  \nDr Helen Pain, Chief Executive of the Royal Society of Chemistry, said: “Great science changes the way we think about things – either through the techniques used, the findings themselves, the products that emerge or even in how we interact with the world and those around us. Importantly, it also allows us to reflect on the incredible people involved in this work and how they have achieved their results.  \n“Although we are in the midst of negotiating a particularly turbulent and challenging era, it is important to celebrate successes and advances in understanding as genuine opportunities to improve our lives. The work of Dr Curchod is a fantastic example of why we celebrate great science, and we’re very proud to recognise their contribution today.”  \nThe Royal Society of Chemistry’s prizes have recognised excellence in the chemical sciences for more than 150 years. In 2019, the organisation announced the biggest overhaul of this portfolio in its history, designed to better reflect modern scientific work and culture.",

The question \"how do stars and planetary systems form and evolve?\" is one of the biggest in Astronomy and is at the root of one of the most important questions in science today: \"How did we get here?\". To resolve these questions we need to observe, interpret, and understand the nature of planets beyond our Solar System. In this talk I will go through the methods, observations, and the physics behind some of the interpretations we are making about the nature of these strange new worlds. As an observer I will show some of the work we have been doing measuring the transmission spectra of giant exoplanet atmospheres looking for the tale-tale absorption of atmospheric gases and the presence of exotic clouds. I will discuss some of the challenges associated with the measurement of atmospheric abundances, a brief look at the role clouds can play in understanding dynamics and chemistry, and what future measurements can help further constrain our understanding of planetary atmospheres.",

This year’s winners join a prestigious list of past winners in the RSC’s prize portfolio, 60 of whom have gone on to win Nobel Prizes for their work,including 2022 Nobel laureate Carolyn Bertozziand 2019 Nobel laureate John B Goodenough.Dr Bzdekalso receives £3,000 and a medal.  \nAfter receiving the prize, Dr Bzdek said: “I am honoured to be awarded the Marlow Prize, and I acknowledge the efforts of my research group and many collaborators who have contributed to the body of work recognised by this prize.”  \nDr Bryan R Bzdek’s research group at the University of Bristol addresses grand challenges in the chemistry of aerosols, which are solid particles or liquid droplets suspended in air. Aerosols are central to climate, health, and materials synthesis. For instance, aerosols are a major contributor to air pollution, serve as the seeds for atmospheric cloud droplets, and are vehicles for disease transmission.  \nWith his group, Dr Bzdek develops new tools to characterise the physical and chemical properties of aerosols. Currently, they are exploring how the surfaces of aerosol particles can affect their ability to grow into cloud droplets and alter climate. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr Bzdek co-led a team of scientists and clinicians who measured respiratory aerosols emitted by humans during a range of tasks, including breathing, speaking, singing, playing musical instruments, exercising, and undergoing medical procedures. This work led directly to changes in UK government guidance in the performing arts and in the NHS England infection control and prevention manual.",

Here, we use the increased light-molecule interactions in high-finesse fiber Fabry-Pérot microcavities to detect individual biomolecules as small as 1.2 kDa with signal-to-noise ratios >100, even as the molecules are freely diffusing in solution. Our method delivers 2D intensity and temporal profiles, enabling the distinction of sub-populations in mixed samples. Strikingly, we observe a linear relationship between passage time and molecular radius, unlocking the potential to gather crucial information about diffusion and solution-phase conformation. Furthermore, mixtures of biomolecule isomers of the same molecular weight can also be resolved. Detection is based on a novel molecular velocity filtering and dynamic thermal priming mechanism leveraging both photo-thermal bistability and Pound-Drever-Hall cavity locking. This technology holds broad potential for applications in life and chemical sciences and represents a major advancement in label-free*in vitro*single-molecule techniques.",

In contrast to the physical world, we live in, creating symmetry in the molecular world is a relatively simple task. It is the daunting asymmetry in molecules that often challenges the chemists.  \nBreaking symmetry to generate asymmetry, commonly termed as desymmetrization, is a remarkably powerful strategy for building molecular complexity. Successful implementation of this strategy holds the potential to forge multiple stereogenic centers in a single step. In fact, stereocenters can also be created away from the reaction site.  \nDuring the past few years, we have developed a number of organocatalytic enantioselective desymmetrization reactions1 from formal C(sp2)‒H alkylations2 and alkenylation3 to the de novo construction of arenes4 and heteroarenes.5 The topic of this talk will be primarily confined to these enantioselective desymmetrization reactions and their applications for the synthesis of complex targets.6  \n##### Further information  \n1.

Anions represent a relatively unexplored frontier in conventional electronic structure methods, due to approximations built into these methods. To navigate the abundance of ‘exotic’ electron attachment states (i.e. non-valence states and resonances), a versatile approach is needed to understand both the experimental signatures and the theoretical chemistry, and to build models able to reproduce and communicate the chemical physics.In this talk, I use a ladder of quantum chemical models to understand how charge, geometry, and substitution/addition of heteroatom/functional groups affect the electronic structure, and therefore the properties of molecules.",

Jones, Department of History, University of Bristol  \n**Time and Location:**3:00 pm in LT4, School of Chemistry, with reception following in School of Chemistry Coffee Lounge  \n**Abstract:**If you lived in early modern Bristol, or any other British city, there was a one-in-four chance that you would die of Plague. This represented an improvement on the previous two centuries. Yersinia Pestis accounted for more deaths than any other infectious agent in English towns. Yet Plague was, ultimately, eradicated in Britain. Bristol's last recorded epidemic was the Great Plague of 1665/6 - an outbreak most have never heard of because, unlike London, Bristol contained the epidemic. 'Only' 0.5 percent of city's population died. This paper will explore the impact of Plague in early modern Bristol, the city's evolving response and the extent to which policies and treatments may have affected transmission. These approaches included the increased use of 'pest houses' (Plague quarantine hospitals) on the edge of the city - one of which was located in 'The Little Park' on the site of what is now the School of Chemistry. The paper will also consider the various ways in which Plague may have been transmitted and it will argue that we need to think more creatively about how this occurred. Beliefs about how the Plague spread in pre-modern Europe are still shaped heavily by the experience of the third pandemic that developed in SE Asia from the late nineteenth century. But the environment of early modern English towns was very different to that of 1890s Hong Kong.",

In fields such as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, superconductors, photovoltaics, batteries and solar-cells, control of crystal growth is highly desired, yet often difficult.  \nOver the years, I have developed ways of controlling and changing the way crystals grow, with a view to altering and improving their functionality. By involving other materials in the growth of crystals, be they simple molecular, polymeric or even biological in origin, my lab has not only been able to exercise control over crystallization but has also gained a deeper understanding into how the physical properties of crystals across all fields can be improved.  \nIn this lecture, I highlight some of the key advances we have made over the years and the implications they have for the performance of advanced functional materials. Occasionally, some very unexpected and interesting things happen…  \nProfessor Simon Hall's research interests are primarily focused on complex functional materials and how, by considered control of crystallization, we can alter and improve their functionality.  \n#### Registration  \nRegistration for this event is free, but you must book a ticket via Eventbrite.  \n##### Further information  \nTuesday, 24th October 2023, 6:00pm - 7:30pm.

    "document": "> The co-operative is led by NPL and promises to deliver an 'integrated network' to expedite the journey towards Net Zero  \n6 April 2023  \nThe Greenhouse Gas Emissions Measurement and Modelling Advancement (GEMMA) programme, was today launched by a National Physical Laboratory (NPL) led research consortium, involving the University of Bristol. Other collaborators include the Met Office; National Centre for Earth Observation; and National Centre for Atmospheric Science. The ultimate aim of the project is to produce a national emissions measurement dashboard for the UK, with the different groups collaborating to create a 'single integreated network to monitor all sources and sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs).'  \nMeeting national GHG reduction targets is difficult challenge. Whilst known and recognised sources and sinks are currently considered within the UK's measurement of net emissions, there is a host of unidentified sources contributing to atmospheric pollution undetected. It is crucial to identify these in order to mitigate and and reduce their impact. According to the NPL, GEMMA will 'cement a “top-down” systems approach to further complement the detail of traditional “bottom-up” inventories and provide the best available UK net emissions information.'  \nThe team is tasked with researching, developing and demonstrating a system which will assess fluctuations in GHG levels on a month-by-month basis. This will be measured over the next two years. This, coupled with investment into new capability, should provide 'powerful and timely insight into the UK's net zero transition.'  \nMatt Rigby, Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of Bristol, said:“To ensure our efforts to tackle climate change are targeted and effective, it’s vital that we produce the most accurate possible estimates of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions. The GEMMA programme will build our capacity to measure greenhouse gases in the UK and use these observations to track our progress toward net-zero.”",

    "document": "> Dr Luke Western, Marie Curie Research Fellow in the School of Chemistry, was the lead author of a new publication which has found that global emissions of several banned ozone-destroying chemicals are increasing.  \n4 April 2023  \nThe findings, published in*Nature Geoscience*, was jointly led by the University of Bristol andNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Although the production of ozone-destroying chemicals - known aschlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)- for most uses is banned under the Montreal Protocol, this rise in emissions is likely a result of a loophole in the rules which states they can be used to create ozone-friendly alternatives to CFCs.  \nAccording to the researchers, emissions from these CFCs currently do not significantly threaten ozone recovery, but because they are potent greenhouse gases they still affect the climate.  \nCFCs are chemicals known to destroy Earth’s protective ozone layer. Once widely used in the manufacture of hundreds of products including aerosol sprays, such as blowing agents for foams and packing materials, solvents, and in refrigeration, CFC production for such uses was banned under the Montreal Protocol in 2010.  \nDr Western said,“We’re paying attention to these emissions now because of the success of the Montreal Protocol. CFC emissions from more widespread uses that are now banned have dropped to such low levels that emissions of CFCs from previously minor sources are more on our radar and under scrutiny.”  \nProfessor Matt Rigby and Professor Simon O'Doherty were also among the study's co-authors.  \nFor more information, read the full story.  \n##### Further information  \nWestern LM, Vollmer MK, Krummel PB, Adcock KE, Fraser PJ, Harth CM, Langenfelds RL, Montzka SA,Mühle J, O'Doherty S, Oram DE, Reimann S, Rigby M, Vimont I, Weiss RF, Young D, Laube JC.

Since the 1980s, the Montreal Protocol – a landmark global environmental agreement – has worked to phase-out man-made gases that destroy the ozone or contribute to climate change.  \nThe 2022 Ozone Assessment provides the most up-to-date information on the progress towards ozone layer recovery and the wider impacts of these harmful gases. The Ozone Assessment is published every four years by the world’s leading scientists in the field and is a vital assessment of recent developments for the parties to the Montreal Protocol and the wider scientific community interested in the Earth’s protective ozone layer.  \nSignificant contributions were made from researchers in the School of Chemistry. One chapter, concerning the climate-warming hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and their replacements, was led by Professor Matt Rigby and co-authored by Dr Kieran Stanley, while a chapter on ozone depleting substances was co-authored by Dr Luke Western and reviewed by Professor Simon O’Doherty. All four researchers contributed to additional chapters within the Assessment.  \nIn addition to the authorship contributions, several areas of research by the School of Chemistry were reported on in the Assessment. New advances on atmospheric breakdown products of HFCs by Professor Andrew Orr-Ewing and Professor Dudley Shallcross featured prominently, and long-term atmospheric measurements made by the Atmospheric Chemistry Research Group underpin much of the analysis of the Montreal Protocol’s progress.",

    "document": "> Researchers have created a unique microscopic toolkit of ‘green’ tuneable electrical components, paving the way for a new generation of bioelectronic devices and sensors.  \nPress release issued: 25 July 2023  \nThe University of Bristol-ledstudy, published today in*The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*(*PNAS*), demonstrates how to make conductive, biodegradable wires from designed proteins. These could be compatible with conventional electronic components made from copper or iron, as well as the biological machinery responsible for generating energy in all living organisms.  \nThe miniscule wires are the size of transistors on silicon chips or one thousandth of the breadth of the finest human hair. They are made completely of natural amino acids and heme molecules, found in proteins such as hemoglobin, which transports oxygen in red blood cells. Harmless bacteria were used for their manufacture, eliminating the need for potentially complex and environmentally damaging procedures commonly used in the production of synthetic molecules.  \nLead author Ross Anderson, Professor of Biological Chemistry at the University of Bristol, said: “While our designs take inspiration from the protein-based electronic circuits necessary for all life on Earth, they are free from much of the complexity and instability that can prevent the exploitation of their natural equivalents on our own terms. We can also build these minute electronic components to order, specifying their properties in a way that is not possible with natural proteins.”  \nLeading experts in biomolecular engineering and simulation worked together to produce this unique new method of designing tailor-made proteins with tuneable electronic properties.  \nThe multidisciplinary team used advanced computational tools to design simple building blocks that could be combined into longer, wire-like protein chains for conducting electrons. They were able to visualise the structures of these wires using protein X-ray crystallography and electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM), techniques which allow structures to be viewed in the finest detail. Pushing the technical boundaries of cryo-EM, images of the smallest individual protein ever studied were obtained with this technique.  \nUltimately, these nanoscale designer wires have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including biosensors for the diagnosis of diseases and detection of environmental pollutants.  \nIt is also hoped this invention will form the foundation of new electrical circuits for creating tailor-made catalysts for green industrial biotechnology and artificial photosynthetic proteins for capturing solar energy.",

They offer exciting possibilities as components for engineering biology and also are great systems for investigating the fundamental mechanisms of biological electron transfer.”  \n**Paper**  \n‘An expandable, modular*de novo*protein platform for precision redox engineering’ by George H.

    "document": "> For the first time, scientists researching in the field of quantum dynamics (QD) will be able to access, develop and deploy a universal software framework for simulations, removing many barriers that exist to achieving a deeper understanding and exploiting new phenomena across the quantum world.  \n26 October 2023  \nScientists use powerful sources of light to study tiny particles, atoms and molecules, that make up the matter around us – known as the quantum domain. These experiments can be used to answer important questions about how the particles behave in chemical reactions, material properties, and new quantum technologies.  \nTo understand the results of the experiments, computer simulations are crucial. The computer-generated virtual model shows how these tiny particles move according to the rules of quantum physics. Using the newly developed quantum simulations, researchers will predict and understand what is happening to molecules during experiments.  \nThis is a new field of research, and most research groups use their own custom-made software for their studies. This individual approach means it is difficult for scientists to use ideas from one group to improve the methods of another group.  \nNow, a new research project called COSMOS, funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (ESPRC) and including researchers at the University of Bristol will develop a unified code for quantum dynamics simulations suitable for use by both computational and experimental researchers. School of Chemistry researcher Dr Basile Curchod is a co-investigator on the project.  \nThis universal software will enable a wider group of scientists worldwide to use computer simulations to explore the quantum world more efficiently, and it will aid researchers across a broad range of research areas to understand state-of-the art experiments and exploit quantum effects by designing new molecules and materials.  \nFor more information, read the full story.",

The chemical structures of natural products have evolved over several millennia for a specific biochemical purpose and their molecular frameworks can be considered privileged scaffolds.(1) This lecture will showcase the synthesis of bioactive natural products and peptides from our own research(2) as examples of underexplored novel structural chemotypes for drug discovery.  \nInspired by their complex architecture and potential as pharmaceutical lead compounds, the spirocyclic imine class of marine toxins (e.g. portimine and 13-desMe spirolide C) have attracted the attention of our research group.3 The total syntheses of these natural products have challenged the repertoire of existing synthetic methods. Examples of new synthetic methods developed by our group(3) whilst engaging in the total synthesis of these unique bioactive natural products will be highlighted.  \nDue to the on-going global expansion of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) infections, and the declining proportion of FDA-approved antimicrobial drugs over the past three decades, AMR is now recognised worldwide as one of the greatest threats facing humankind in the 21st century. Antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs) exist widely throughout nature and protect organisms from infection by destroying a broad range of pathogens. Due to the unique and non-specific bactericidal mechanism of action of AMPs, AMPs have a lower tendency to elicit antibiotic resistance than conventional antibiotics and are potentially useful therapeutic agents. The chemical synthesis and biological activity of several representative examples of antimicrobial peptides/proteins will also be described.(4)  \n##### Further information  \n1 “Natural Product Derived Privileged Scaffolds in Drug Discovery,” E.

He is also interestedin the discovery, structure, mechanism and engineering of enzymes for synthetic applications, including the integration of enzymes with chemocatalysis for telescoping routes topharmaceuticals and other valuable products [1-7]. The Micklefield lab is also engaged in nucleic acids research.  \nNature uses enzymes to catalyse reactions building all of the molecules required for life. Enzymes also break down molecules to release energy that enables all living organismsto move forward. Our lab discovers novel enzymes from unusual bacteria in nature. We characterise these enzymes to determine their structures andmechanisms. With this knowledge, we can re-programme the enzymes to create variants that can catalyse new reactions.These engineered enzymes are used to produce novel antibiotics to combat antimicrobial resistance, antiviral agents that entered clinical trials for COVID-19, anticancer agentsand other useful molecules [1-7]. The enzymatic pathways we have developed are cleaner and more sustainable than the traditional chemical synthesis routes that are currently used toprepare pharmaceuticals and other molecules.  \n##### Further information  \n[1] Merging enzymes with chemocatalysis for sustainable amide bond synthesis.

For example, an excited-state molecule is both a better electron-donor(i.e. a better reductant)and electron-acceptor(i.e. a better oxidant)than in the ground state. This explains why light excitation of organic molecules can unlock unconventional reactivity manifolds.  \nIn this context, our laboratory has been exploring the potential of some organocatalytic intermediates to directly reach an electronically excited state upon visible-light absorption to then switch on novel catalytic functions unavailable to ground-state organocatalysis. Studying the mechanisms of these photochemical approaches allowed us to expand the synthetic possibilities offered by the excited-state reactivity of organocatalytic intermediates and to develop enantioselective radical processes.",

Tim was keen to expand the horizons of all he taught and worked with, and many former pupils and colleagues speak very fondly of the support and encouragement they received.  \nIn 2002, at an event for schoolteachers hosted by the Royal Society of Chemistry, Tim met Dudley Shallcross, a member of academic staff in the School of Chemistry at Bristol University, and an enduring partnership and friendship was born. Whilst still working as a teacher, Tim started to organise and run laboratory visits and many other activities for school students at Bristol University. In 2005, Tim was appointed by the University to be in charge of a new chemistry school’s outreach programme.  \nTim’s talent and passion for this work saw a very rapid growth and development of school’s outreach work. Supported by excellent technicians, students and staff as well as the Royal Society of Chemistry, Tim devised a wide range of activities, tours and talks for school students of all ages and backgrounds, including students with disabilities. Tim worked with university students, training them in teaching and public engagement, with teachers and with school students and, very quickly, his impact spread not just all over the UK but also well beyond its borders.  \nTim travelled many thousands of miles, visiting schools, science festivals and other universities all over the UK and overseas. Tim would regularly visit primary schools bringing practical activities for the children to try and showing the children amazing chemical reactions. Tim’s ability as a presenter of potentially hazardous chemistry experiments, carried out live - and safely - before an audience will be fondly remembered by many, many thousands of people. At this, Tim was extremely talented, possessing enormous knowledge and skill as well as a great sense of humour.  \nIn 2007, Tim and Dudley recommended the concept of embedding a schoolteacher within a university’s chemistry department to the Royal Society of Chemistry. With Government funding several more teachers became employed at universities all over the UK, carrying out school’s outreach work.",

With Government funding several more teachers became employed at universities all over the UK, carrying out school’s outreach work.  \nIn 2007, working with his great friend, Professor Mike Davies-Coleman of Rhodes University, South Africa, by training university staff and students and working at science festivals, Tim helped to set up an outreach programme for school pupils and teachers from South Africa and Namibia, work that continues to this day.  \nIn 2010, Tim began a long collaboration with Dr Magda Wajrak at Edith Cowan University (ECU), Perth, Australia. This was so successful, and impacted the lives of so many, that the Vice Chancellor of ECU invited Tim to be part of the celebration of the opening of the new Science Building in 2020.  \nOver his 17 years at the University of Bristol, Tim gave approximately 3000 chemistry demonstration lectures (not counting many hundreds more by partners in other countries).  \nFrom 2005 to 2020, before the pandemic, Tim worked directly with 30,000-50,000 people (teachers, students and audiences of all kinds) each year.  \nTim worked with colleagues in Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Spain, France, Italy, Malta, USA, The West Indies, Hong Kong and Ireland. Tim published over 150 papers, won the 2004 RSC Teaching Award, the Big Tick award in 2008, 2009 and 2010, was part of the team that won the Times HE ICT award in 2009, the Merrill Lynch Science Education award in 2009 and the Royal Society’s Hauksbee award in 2009.  \nTim was diagnosed with cancer in 2015 and although Tim’s pace of work did slow, in 2018 he teamed up with Dr Jonny Furze, a recently graduated research chemist. Jonny’s great ability and energy allowed Tim to carry on effectively at his work for another two years before the pandemic stopped face to face outreach.  \nTim was the nicest of people, intelligent, witty and generous to a fault. A man who didn’t bear grudges and who loved his family dearly. He was a phenomenal educator who was working his magic to the very end of his life.  \nTim, you made it so, in every sense.

The technology, pioneered at Bristol, is uniquely suited for producing next-generation vaccines in large quantities in insect cells that can be easily cultured at low cost in Vietnam.  \nTo mark the funding announcement, and to kick-off Vaccine Hub operations, University of Bristol researchers including Professor Imre Berger welcomed representatives from the Vietnamese Ministry of Health, the Vietnamese Embassy in the UK, the CEO and research team of Vabiotech, and leading vaccine scientists and Hub partners from Imperial College London with a reception in the Wills Memorial Building. The visit included a tour of Bristol’s high-tech facilities, including robotics laboratories, the cryogenic electron microscopy facility, and the new biosafety level 3 virology laboratories, all of which were established during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nProfessor Berger, Director of theMax Planck-Bristol Centre for Minimal Biologyat the University of Bristol and the Bristol FVMR Hub lead, said: \"Our partner Vabiotech is particularly interested in using the technology we developed in Bristol to produce vaccines to combat rabies and avian flu, both major challenges in Vietnam. We saw just a few years ago how quickly avian flu, which began in Vietnam, developed into a global threat for humans around the world. Together with Vabiotech, we will put cutting-edge technology in place to afford cost-effective protection.  \n##### Further information  \nFor more information, read the full story.",

Working in collaboration with the Worldwide Universities Network, each talk will be presented by a leading Brazilian academic.  \n*Location:**School of Chemistry, LT2, 11 AM - 12 PM***  \n**Prof. Dr. Eufrânio Júnior (Federal University of Minas Gerais)**  \n**Title:***“It Only Takes One Idea and One Quinone: On the Application of Diverse Catalytic Methods towards Bioactive Quinoidal Compounds”*  \n**Abstract:**Our group has developed practical methods for design, synthesizeand optimize new heterocyclic compounds with a broad range of biological applications. In this context, we revealed the synthesis and biological evaluations (e.g. bioimaging, cellular uptake and dynamics in living cells) of new fluorescent heterocyclic compounds, which have allowed visualizing the whole endocytic pathway and selective cellular staining of lipid-based structures, that is, lipid inclusions in the cytosol. In addition, modular synthesis via organocatalysis of diverse naphthoquinones and selenium-containing quinone-based triazoles possessing two redox centres, with trypanocidal and antitumor activities were recently described by our group. This lecture will present a combination of strategies in Medicinal Chemistry and synthetic methodologies, as for instance, transition metal catalysed C–H activation reactions for the synthesis of bioactive compounds. The development of reactions that produces in a single step trypanocidal naphthoquinoidal compounds will be presented, along with recently developed iodination, oxygenation, alkenylation, thiolation and selenation processes. The use of electrochemistry and nanocatalysis will also be explored in this seminar. Finally, strategies and reactions to prepare fluorescent compounds used to monitor enzymatic processes will also be briefly discussed.  \n---  \n**Prof. Dr. Eduardo Eliezer Alberto (Federal University of Minas Gerais)**  \n**Title:***\"Design of Organocatalysts and Protocols for Enzymatic Inspired Transformations\"*  \n**Abstract:**Taking inspiration from the activity of enzymes, organochalcogen species have been designed, prepared, and evaluated for their catalytic performance in facilitating various organic reactions, including brominations and alkylations. A central objective of this research is to enhance the environmental aspects associated with these transformations, such as replacing organic solvents with aqueous solutions and utilizing less hazardous reagents.  \n---  \n*Location:***School of Biomedical Sciences, F40, 12 PM**  \n**Dr. Rubem F.

Further details of the talk are in the post below.  \n11 March 2024  \n**Time and Location:**2:00 PM, 14th March, Chemistry LT3  \n**Speaker:** Dr. Marcus A. Johns, Department of Wood Science, University of British Columbia  \n**Title:** Autofluorescence spectroscopy for heteroatomic materials characterization & development  \n**Abstract:**  \nCluster-triggered emission is an autoluminescence phenomenon that occurs in non-aromatic compounds, such as polysaccharides and amino acids, when they aggregate, or cluster, together. The mechanism behind this involves heteroatoms with free electron pairs, such as oxygen or nitrogen, involved in inter- and intra-molecular dipole-dipole interactions, n,π\\* interactions, or through space interactions with one another. As such, spectroscopy based on the technique may be used to directly characterize the molecular interactions that form the supramolecular structure of materials with suitable chemical groups. In this seminar, current applications of the technique based on empirical observations will be discussed. This will include determining key physicochemical properties of cellulose nanocrystals and the identification of common textile microplastics in conjunction with assisted machine learning. Furthermore, the mechanisms behind the phenomenon will be considered, covering ongoing research into the potential importance of secondary chemical structures. Finally, a broad vision regarding potential future analytical applications will be presented.",

    "document": "> A pioneering University of Bristol chemist who has helped more than 10,000 teachers across the UK and worldwide inspire and educate the next generation of scientists has been recognised in the 2024 King’s Birthday Honours.  \nPress release issued: 14 June 2024  \n**Dudley Shallcross**, Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry, has been awarded an OBE for his outstanding contribution to Science education in the UK and overseas.  \nProfessor Shallcross said: “My daughter picked up the morning post with an envelope from the Cabinet Office, so I invited her to open it. It was quite a surprise and my whole family is now very excited. They have been incredibly supportive throughout my career, as have all the brilliantly talented people I’ve been fortunate to work with over the years. So, this award is a massive collective and I just want to say the biggest thank you!”  \nHis teaching career started at the University as a lecturer in chemistry in 1999 after studying at the universities of Southampton, Oxford and Cambridge. The following year sparked his interest in nurturing science talent in children, which fast became a lifelong passion.  \n“In my second year, I was offered a couple of admin jobs, but I chose schools outreach, which wasn’t a popular choice with young academics at the time. But I really enjoyed it and soon met with secondary school teachers across the city, forging an effective link with the University,” Professor Shallcross said.  \nWithin a few years he was awarded the University’s first National Teaching Fellowship and soon after the School of Chemistry was made a Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning, calledBristol ChemLabS.  \nA firm believer in bringing the laboratory to life, Professor Shallcross and the Bristol ChemLabS team pioneered virtual labs, preparing students for laboratories by building on their enthusiasm and competence. Training and supporting science teachers using the new real and virtual labs gave these teachers, many not chemistry specialists, confidence to conduct experiments, including the more dramatic ones, with students.  \nHe said: “Creating experiments is the magic of chemistry, but some teachers were fearful of them. If done properly and safely, they can help inspire future scientists, sparking their curiosity and appetite to learn.”  \nHis extensive outreach work has involved bringing secondary schools from across the country and globe into the School of Chemistry labs.  \n“Out of term time, our labs were packed with children not only from UK schools, but also from Ireland, France, Malta, and Singapore to name a few. It was brilliant,” he said.  \nHis revolutionary work continued when he was appointed Director of thePrimary Science Teaching Trust– a role which allowed him to transform the dynamic of teaching science at primary school level.",

Having a science background to teach science at a primary level is not essential, it’s about developing inquisitive natures,” Professor Shallcross said.  \nIn 2020 he was made President of the Education Division at the Royal Society of Chemistry, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. His experience in virtual lab work and instruments proved pivotal, and helped scores of institutions deliver practical learning during public lockdown restrictions.  \nA staunch champion of Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (ED&I), Professor Shallcross introduced virtual labs at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa. It has since been rolled out across the country, where access to laboratories is limited.  \n“The virtual lab environment develops skills, lowers anxiety, and reduces breakages. It’s so popular that students have collectively spent as long in the virtual labs as an actual one, which is hugely satisfying and an important step forward in overcoming inequalities and developing fantastic talent,” Professor Shallcross explained.  \n“Working with students and teachers from a variety of backgrounds, for example South African townships and first peoples in Australia has been a privilege. We have learned so much from each other and lifelong friendships have been formed.”  \nThe summer schools have also supported visually impaired adults, giving blind students their first experience in a lab and an opportunity to perform exciting experiments.  \nHe added: “This is one of the most satisfying parts of my work – supporting people to change the course of their life and be passionate about science.”  \nProfessor Shallcross lives locally with his wife Karen and their four children, who he hopes will join him at the investiture ceremony.  \nHe said: “This award is the culmination of a massive team effort, thanks to my amazing family and colleagues. I’m incredibly grateful and proud of them all. I must pay tribute in particular to my very good friend and colleague Tim Harrison, who worked with me on many of these projects and sadly died in January last year, before being able to accept an MBE award.”",

    "document": "> The School of Chemistry's Professor Carmen Galan is among a multi-centre group of scientists to have found a way to create artificial sugars that could lead to better ways to diagnose and treat diseases more accurately than ever before.  \n8 October 2024  \nSugars play a crucial role in human health and disease, far beyond being just an energy source. Complex sugars called glycans coat all our cells and are essential for healthy function. However, these sugars are often hijacked by pathogens such as influenza, COVID-19, and cholera to infect us.  \nOne big problem in treating and diagnosing diseases and infections is that the same glycan can bind to many different proteins, making it hard to understand exactly what’s happening in the body and has made it difficult to develop precise medical tests and treatments.  \nIn a breakthrough, published in the journal*Nature Communications,*a collaboration of academic and industry experts in Europe have found a way to create unnatural sugars that could block the pathogens.  \nThe researchers used a combination of enzymes and chemical synthesis to edit the structure of 150 sugars by adding fluorine atoms. Fluorine is very small meaning that the sugars keep their same 3D shape, but the fluorine’s interfere with how proteins bind them.  \nThe finding offers apromising avenue to new drugs and could also open doors in diagnostics by ‘capturing’ the pathogens or their toxins.  \nProfessor Galan said “One of the key technologies used in this work is biocatalysis, which uses enzymes to produce the very complex and diverse sugars needed for the library.  \n\"However, enzymes can be very specific for their substrate so in order to screen a large panel of biocatalysts that can act upon unnatural glycans, we employed an approach that uses clickable positively charged imidazolium-based tags (ITags) that allows for fast screening of reactivity by mass spectrometry”.  \nThe team found that some of the sugars they prepared could be used to detect the cholera toxin – a harmful protein produced by bacteria – meaning they could be used in simple, low-cost tests, similar to lateral flow tests, widely used for pregnancy testing and during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nThe study provides evidence that the artificial “fluoro-sugars” can be used to fine-tune pathogen or biomarker recognition or even to discover new drugs. They also offer an alternative to antibodies in low-cost diagnostics, which do not require animals test to discover and are heat stable.  \nThe research team included researchers from eight different universities, including Manchester, Imperial College London, Leeds, Warwick, Southampton, York, Bristol, and Ghent University in Belgium and the biotechnology company Prozomix.  \n##### Further information",

    "document": "> Researchers in the School of Chemistry have contributed towards a recent paper in Nature that describes a new type of insulin which responds to the amount of glucose in the blood, becoming more active at high levels when it is needed and less active at low levels.  \n28 October 2024  \nType 1 diabetics need to inject insulin regularly to control their glucose levels, but run the risk of injecting too much leading to dangerously low glucose concentrations. Insulins that adjust their activity could be much safer.  \nThe work originated with the design and synthesis of “GluHUT” (Glucose-Binding Hexaurea Temple), a remarkably effective glucose receptor, in the group of Professor Anthony Davis. This discovery was commercialised through spin-out company Ziylo, which was sold to Novo Nordisk in 2018.  \nA new company, Carbometrics, was founded as a successor to Ziylo, and worked with Novo Nordisk to develop the insulin as reported in the paper. Several of the authors on the paper are alumni of the School of Chemistry, including Andy Chapman, Chief Executive Officer of Carbometrics, and Rob Tromans, who made the first sample of GluHUT.  \nThe research demonstrates the concept of glucose sensitive insulin and shows that it can be effective in animals, a step towards developing a version for use in humans.  \n##### Further information  \nGlucose-sensitive insulin with attenuation of hypoglycaemia.

The centre shares funding from the first tranche of a major £80million research and innovation investment that will support the latest technology and scientific instrumentation to safeguard heritage for future generations and will boost the UK’s heritage economy.  \nThe University of Bristol has a long history of pioneering mass spectrometric methodologies for molecular and isotope analyses in the heritage sciences with world-leading expertise and infrastructure that spans and integrates three schools and two faculties: theDepartment of Anthropology and Archaeologyin theSchool of Arts, theOrganic Geochemistry Unitin theSchool of Chemistryand theBristol Isotope Grouphoused in theSchool of Earth Sciences.  \nFacilities included under the centre umbrella include an ultra-compact, high-precision radiocarbon accelerator. The BRAMS radiocarbon dating facility was established by the School of Chemistry in 2016 and housed in the Department of Anthropology and Archaeology. This has led to major methodological developments, including the capability toradiocarbon date individual preserved fatty acids from food residues extracted from archaeological pottery.  \nThe School of Chemistry and Department of Anthropology and Archaeology laboratories are also equipped with a unique suite of state-of-the-art organic mass spectrometry and isotope ratio mass spectrometry instruments for highly sensitive and selective analyses of molecular and isotopic signals held in archaeological materials. These typically include organic residues preserved in archaeological pottery, dietary signals in human and animal skeletal remains, climatic signals held in historic parchments, pigments and binders used in works of art and ancient Egyptian mummy balms.  \nAdditionally, the Bristol Isotope Group uses world-leading mass spectrometric instrumentation to explore intra-lifetime patterns in human and animal diet and mobility from isotope signatures in biological remains.  \nThe School of Chemistry's Professor Richard Evershed, a coinvestigator in the team led by Dr Lucy Cramp, said: “The new centre builds on more than 30 years of research at the University of Bristol focussed on developing and applying analytical chemistry in the field of heritage science. The RICHeS programme is a highly imaginative vehicle for sharing the expertise and approaches of leading heritage science proponents with the wider UK research community.”  \n##### Further information  \nFor more information, read the full story.",

    "document": "> A University of Bristol scientist has been awarded the Environment, Sustainability & Energy mid-career Prize by the Royal Society of Chemistry for his pioneering work in monitoring the changing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  \n12 June 2024  \nProfessor Matthew Rigbyfrom theSchool of Chemistryuses observations and computer simulations to research the abundances and fluxes of environmentally harmful gases in the atmosphere, which has contributed to a measurable reduction in emissions of ozone-depleting gases.  \nProfessor Rigby’s work is at the intersection of atmospheric chemistry and physics, Bayesian statistics, machine learning and numerical modelling.  \nAtmospheric observations contain a wealth of information on the sources and sinks of greenhouse gases and substances that deplete the stratospheric ozone layer.  \nUnderstanding the processes responsible for the changing levels of these compounds is critical for evaluating the progress on climate agreements, and Professor Rigby’s advances in this field have allowed him to quantify global emissions trends of more than 30 compounds relevant to the Montreal Protocol and Paris Agreement.  \nProfessor Rigby’s work is now routinely used to evaluate the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions and spot unexpected greenhouse gas sources.  \nProfessor Rigby said: “I am enormously grateful to be awarded this prize, and I’d like to acknowledge the role of my wonderful colleagues in Bristol and around the world. Without them, my work wouldn’t be possible.”  \nThe Environment, Sustainability & Energy Division mid-career Prize is awarded by theRoyal Society of Chemistryfor outstanding contributions made by mid-career scientists in the relevant fields. Professor Rigby will receive a £3,000 prize and will complete a UK lecture tour highlighting his work.  \nDr Helen Pain, Chief Executive of the Royal Society of Chemistry, said: “The chemical sciences cover a rich and diverse collection of disciplines, from fundamental understanding of materials and the living world to applications in medicine, sustainability, technology and more.  \n“By working together across borders and disciplines, chemists are finding solutions to some of the world’s most pressing challenges. Their passion, dedication and brilliance are an inspiration. I extend my warmest congratulations to them all.”  \nThe Royal Society of Chemistry’s prizes have recognised excellence in the chemical sciences for more than 150 years. This year’s winners join a prestigious list of past winners in the RSC’s prize portfolio, 60 of whom have gone on to win Nobel Prizes for their work.",

This prize recognises inspirational teaching and making a positive difference in curriculum design, implementation, and assessment in the wider community.  \n15 April 2024  \n**Speaker:**Dr Allison Hill (University of Exeter)  \n**Host:**Prof Chris Willis  \n**Time and Location:**2:00PM - 3:00PM, 17th April, Chemistry Building, LT2  \n**Title:**'Unique data sets for robust and authentic online open book assessments'  \n**Abstract:**  \nOnline assessments where there is a clear ‘correct’ answer are susceptible to students working together, sharing (or even selling) answers. The challenge we faced was to take a 1 hour, closed-book invigilated exam and turn it into a 24 hour, open book, non-invigilated exam. Our approach was to provide every student with their own data set based on a single historical student-generated data set. This enabled all students to have data of equivalent difficulty but with unique answers and different outcomes. Student performance was unchanged despite the very different examination conditions, however, marking times for the data section of the exam doubled. We have now developed code that allows us to mark this section of the exam automatically meaning that our method is now fully scalable.  \nOur students have told us that personalised exams give them confidence their peers are not colluding/cheating as the incentive and opportunity to do so is significantly reduced. Since pioneering the use of unique data sets to personalise assessments, colleagues have developed their own approaches to individualise assessments. We believe that this approach can be used more widely to improve assessment robustness and authenticity. We have now extended this work to create a gamification session for our students which we use to consolidate learning in a fun and engaging way.",

    "document": "> New research has uncovered that factories worldwide are failing to adequately eliminate a highly potent greenhouse gas produced during the manufacturing of fluoropolymers, such as Teflon, and refrigerants.  \n22 August 2024  \nThe study investigated a known disparity between real and reported emissions of this gas, prompting calls for more countries to sign up to official agreements to limit emissions and for their Teflon factories to be independently audited to ensure compliance.  \nThe research, published today in the journal*Nature*, scrutinised emissions of one of the most potent hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) greenhouse gases called trifluoromethane, also known as HFC-23. Its main source is as a by-product in the industrial production of certain refrigerants and Teflon, which is used in products such as nonstick cookware. More than 150 countries have pledged to significantly reduce their HFC-23 emissions as part of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.  \nSince 2020, all Teflon manufacturers are obligated to destroy the strong greenhouse gas. According to the reports of the individual countries producing these products, this is happening. On paper the global annual emissions of HFC-23 were only 2,000 tons in 2020 but the actual global emissions, shown in numerous studies, uncover a different picture. In 2020 alone, around 16,000 tons of the greenhouse gas were previously found to be released into the atmosphere.  \nTo unravel this discrepancy, researchers from the University of Bristol in the UK, Empa in Switzerland, and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research compared HFC-23 levels reported by individual countries with actual levels emitted from a Teflon factory in the Netherlands. To record the emissions as comprehensively and accurately as possible, a novel technique was used. This involved releasing a tracer directly next to the factory: a non-toxic gas that does not occur in the atmosphere and decomposes within a few weeks. At a distance of around 25 kilometres, they then measured the concentrations of HFC-23 and other by-products of Teflon manufacture – and also the concentration of the tracer.  \nFirst author Dr Dominique Rust, a Research Associate at the University of Bristol School of Chemistry, said: “Since we knew exactly how much tracer we had released and how much of it arrived at the measuring point, we were able to calculate the emissions of HFC-23 and other gases.”  \nResults showed that even though estimated emissions are higher than those reported by the factory, measures to curb HFC-23 levels are largely effective.  \nThe findings indicated that if all factories globally were controlling emissions in the same way as the one studied, HFC-23 emissions could be cut by around 85%. This reduction equates to almost one fifth (17%) of carbon dioxide emissions generated by all aviation traffic.",

This reduction equates to almost one fifth (17%) of carbon dioxide emissions generated by all aviation traffic.  \nDr Rust, who worked on the study as part of her doctorate at Empa, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, added: “The collaboration with the Teflon manufacturer and the Dutch authorities was key to understanding the real picture.”  \nCo-author Dr Martin Vollmer, Researcher at Empa, said: “We suspect higher actual readings in the global atmosphere are explained by some countries underreporting emissions, resulting in this disconnect. One explanation is that abatement technologies aren’t as effectively implemented globally as at the factory we investigated.\"  \nThe researchers are calling for factories to be independently audited. This independent verification of greenhouse gas emissions from the production of fluoropolymers and refrigerants would help close gaps in understanding the emission sources and check that countries are fully compliant under different international climate and environment agreements.  \nCo-author Dr Kieran Stanley, Senior Research Fellow at the University of Bristol, said:\"Studies like this can help us to independently verify reported declines in emissions from fluorochemical plants and ensure that countries are reaching their obligations under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.  \n\"These results are therefore really encouraging and show that abatement of emissions from fluorochemical plants producing fluoropolymers like Teflon can significantly reduce emissions of a highly potent greenhouse gas.”  \nThe researchers are now planning another study in South Korea in October which will involve using the tracer method to determine the emissions of other halogenated substances in the capital city Seoul.  \n**Paper**  \n'Effective realization of abatement measures can reduce HFC-23 emissions' by D Rust et al in*Nature*",

They are particularly important for transport within the neuronal axons. and are dysregulated in many neurodegenerative diseases.  \nThe team will aim to obtain a deep mechanistic understanding of the kinesin-1 autoinhibitory mechanism; insight into how cargo engagement induces conformational changes in the complex; and a clear understanding of the nature of active motor-cargo complexes. They will apply the latest protein/peptide design approaches to identify strategies and targets for manipulating kinesin activity, setting the stage for future work to apply these technologies to finely control kinesin-mediated transport in disease states.  \nThis four-year award will commence in 2025.",

    "document": "> A collaborative multidisciplinary project involving researchers at the Universities of Bristol, Oxford and Manchester as well as collaborators at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, has demonstrated the synthesis of a new allotrope of carbon, a cyclocarbon that is stable enough at room temperature for spectroscopic characterisation in solution.  \n15 August 2025  \nThe breakthrough is reported in a recently published article in the journal *Science*, with the School of Chemistry's Dr Paul Gates among the co-authors.  \nThe synthesis of a new type of molecular carbon allotrope that can be studied under normal laboratory conditions is a rare achievement. The only previous example was the first synthesis of fullerenes in research led by Wolfgang Krätschmer, as published in the journal*Nature* in 1990.  \nPreviously, cyclocarbons have only been studied in the gas phase and on surfaces at temperatures below 10 K. In this study, Cyclo[48]carbon was synthesised as a [4] catenane, for example with the C48 ring threaded through three other macrocycles. These threaded macrocycles increase the stability of C48.  \nThe cyclocarbon catenane was characterised by mass spectrometry, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), UV-visible and Raman spectroscopy. The observation of a single intense 13C NMR resonance for all 48 sp1 carbon atoms provides strong evidence for the cyclocarbon catenane structure.  \nThe principal investigator on the project was Professor Harry Anderson (University of Oxford), who said the ’mass spectrometry capabilities' at the University of Bristol were 'certainly crucial for completion of this study’.  \n##### Further information  \nGao Y, Gupta P, Rončević I, Mycroft C, Gates PJ, Parker AW, and Anderson HL. 2025 Solution-phase stabilization of a cyclocarbon by catenane formation.*Science*",

However, after many years of research, the team succeeded in developing GluHUT - a synthetic glucose receptor that overcomes these challenges and shows excellent performance in both strength and selectivity.  \n“I’m delighted that our work has been recognised,\" said Professor Davis. \"And very grateful to all who contributed to three decades of research in Dublin and Bristol.  \n\"I’m also pleased to receive the award as an applied scientist. It is especially satisfying that work which began as curiosity-driven, with little hope of application, eventually produced results of real practical benefit.”  \nThe Royal Medals were founded by HM King George IV in 1825. Between 1826 and 1964 two medals were awarded each year. In 1965 the third medal, covering the applied sciences, was introduced on behalf of HM Queen Elizabeth II.  \n##### Further information  \nFor more information, read the full story.",

Giving examples of current female researchers in science for example, some schools have made contact with these researchers and carried out on-line meets. One school has featured a female scientist from this project each month and reports a very positive impact of attitudes to science from girls in the school.  \nThe diversity of the researchers whose work has been featured, has been noted by teachers and encouraged these young learners to see 'a scientist just like them'. Some researchers have visual or hearing impairments or other disabilities and this has been important to show that perceived barriers can be overcome.  \nThe research collaborations across cultures and countries have been important and it has been reported that children in school enjoy finding out where the various countries are and their cultures. Of course, children love the idea of engaging with current research, see [1, 2] for more detailed teacher feedback. The teachers report much engagement and enthusiasm undertaking the hands-on science activities and some teachers have used these resources to change their curriculum and ways of working.  \n##### Further information  \n**The team**  \nPrimary Science Teaching Trust primary Science Teacher of the Year award winners:  \n* Dr Alison Trew\n* Dr Rececca Ellis\n* Dr Craig Early\n* Dr Julia Nash\n* Dr Katharine Pemberton\n* Dr Paul Tyler  \nNaomi Shallcross, Hutton Church of England Primary School, North Somerset  \nTim Harrison and Professor Dudley Shallcross, University of Bristol  \nYou can find further information and resources on the Primary Science Teaching trust website.  \n[1] A.

This led to a series of high-profile articles on the topic of ‘organic biomineralization’ and was recognized by the 2025 Blavatnik Award.  \nHis new 'CRYST\\_ALGAE' Consolidator Grant will explore a new frontier in this field - the functions of crystals in photosynthetic microalgae. Recently, molecular crystals, like those investigated in animals, were found to be widespread in superabundant and ecological important microalgae. However, rather than performing optical functions, in these organisms, the nitrogen-dense crystals function as nitrogen-storage reservoirs, enabling cells to circumvent periods of nutrient starvation.  \nHe will use the grant to explore the functions of nitrogen-storage crystals in microalgae as well as the biotechnological and biogeochemical implications of this behaviour.",

The facility includes equipment for measuring the key greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), in addition to carbon monoxide (CO), which acts as an indirect greenhouse gas and provides a useful tracer for combustion emissions. A high-precision analyser for monitoring atmospheric hydrogen (H2) will also soon be in action at the site.  \nMeasurements collected there will be added to a long-term dataset gathered by the UK’s Deriving Emissions linked to Climate Change (DECC) network. These measurements are combined with a computer model representing the transport of gases from the emission sources to the measurement locations. This allows scientists to estimate the size and location of emissions for each measured gas. The total UK emissions estimated for CH4and N2O using this method are included in the UK’s National Inventory Report, which is submitted annually to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  \nThe School of Chemistry's Professor Simon O’Doherty said: “We can only understand the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by making continuous high-quality, physical measurements of the atmosphere.  \n\"The current UK network of monitoring stations set up in 2012 has been a huge success in furthering our understanding, however, the addition of the Jodrell Bank station to the network will enhance our ability to determine emissions in the north-west region of the UK.”  \n##### Further information  \nFor more information, read the full story.",

In Earth’s atmosphere, droplets of this size are commonly found in clouds, fog and sea-spray, and they also form when organic particles from wildfires or human pollution condense water vapour from the surrounding air.  \nThe PHAERO (Ultrafast Photochemistry in Organic Aerosols) project will explore how organic compounds in these microdroplets are affected by the ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B radiation in sunlight. The work will deepen our understanding of how organic aerosol particles change their chemical composition and physical properties over time in the Earth’s atmosphere. These changes determine how these airborne particles influence the Earth’s climate by absorption or scattering of sunlight, causing net warming or cooling respectively.  \nUsing cutting-edge laser technology in a new laboratory funded by the ERC grant, the research will observe chemical changes in single droplets on ultrafast timescales corresponding to the breaking of chemical bonds or collisions between molecules in solution. By developing a better understanding of how UV light interacts with molecules confined in small droplets, the project will help to unravel the fates of the particulate matter adversely affecting air quality in our cities, and emitted from the growing incidences of wildfires.  \nThe outcomes will also find broader applications, for example in developing photochemistry in small droplets as a new strategy for sustainable synthesis of fine chemicals, or use of germicidal ultraviolet C irradiation to prevent the spread of pathogens in exhaled respiratory droplets.  \nProfessor Orr-Ewing is one of 281 leading researchers across Europe to be awarded an Advanced Grant in the latest competition.

The applications of quantum information science are rapidly expanding beyond quantum computing, but the ramifications for solution phase chemical reactions remain largely unexplored.  \nNew multidimensional ultrafast experimental techniques will be designed to read out the developing spin-state and its entanglement at much faster timescales than have hitherto been possible from magnetic resonance experiments - looking critically at chemical phenomena through a new lens.  \nThe innovative experiments will correlate spin with both electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom, exploiting recent cutting-edge developments in short-pulse broadband deep-ultraviolet laser sources. Their discoveries will reveal how the quantum mechanical state imprinted by light maps through into specific distributions of products crucially determining the overall outcome of photochemical reaction and potentially laying the foundations for new high-value chemical synthetic products.  \n##### Further information  \nFor more information, read the full University of Bristol press release.",

The replacement compounds are hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) containing a C=C bond that is vulnerable to attack by OH and ozone in the lower atmosphere. However, led by discoveries in Bristol and elsewhere, concern is growing about the products of this oxidation chemistry which include CF3H and CF4, both of which are greenhouse gases, as well as trifluoracetic acid (TFA, a persistent environmental pollutant).  \nThe new NERC project, entitled \"Quantifying the production of environmentally damaging compounds from atmospheric oxidation of hydrofluoroolefins\" will use a simulation chamber in the School's Atmospheric Chemistry Research Group laboratory to quantify the yields of products such as CF3H and CF4 from this oxidation chemistry for various different HFOs and related compounds. The outcomes will be included in atmospheric chemistry models to assess the environmental and climate consequences of greater use of HFOs.",

He has done this by developing a thorough understanding for a ubiquitous type of protein-protein interaction; namely, the coiled coils, which assemble proteins in all organisms.*  \n*Woolfson's work uses bioinformatics approaches to understand, predict, and model coiled-coil structures, and then applies these to design experimental systems that expand on peptide/protein structures and assemblies observed in nature. He uses his insights and methods to address challenges in fundamental and applied science, including designing polypeptides for chemical and synthetic biology, and biotechnology.*”  \n**Professor Jonathan Clayden** designs, synthesises and characterises molecules with dynamic three-dimensional shapes that allow them to react in unusual ways or to display functional behaviour. He is particularly interested in making molecules that display functions typically characteristic of biology, and the reactions he has discovered allow access to classes of molecules that complement their natural counterparts.  \nHis Royal Society citation states:  \n“*Jonathan Clayden is a chemist who has explored and exploited the dynamic conformational properties of organic molecules in solution. His research revealed that extended ‘dynamic foldamers’ can communicate structural information over remarkable distances through a range of mechanisms, imitating the responsive functions of more complex biological structures.*  \n*He has introduced new classes of atropisomers, exploiting the properties that arise from slow rotation about single bonds, and his work has uncovered several new types of reactivity that emerge from conformationally constrained molecules*.”  \n##### Further information  \nMore details can be found on the University of Bristol press release.",

P-ligands are often arduous and expensive to make, as well as being air-sensitive, highly toxic and foul-smelling. In view of this catalogue of undesirable properties, why are P-ligands so successful? Answering this question will be one of the themes of this lecture.  \nWe have concentrated on exploring P-ligands that are of academic interest because of their unusual chemical structure, but have always had an eye on potential applications for the curiosities we have produced. For example, complex ligands derived from one of the simplest phosphorus(III) compounds, PH3, via sequential hydrophosphinations (P–H additions), have led to a fascinating array of cyclic, bicyclic and cage phosphines that, in collaboration with industrial partners, have been shown to produce impressive catalysts for alkene carbonylation and hydroformylation. By pushing the boundaries of what is possible with P-ligands (e.g. with ligands containing P–F or P–B bonds), we have discovered systems that 'break the rules' in some areas of homogeneous catalysis and examples of this concept will be presented.  \nRecently we have applied the lessons learned from designing P-ligands for homogeneous catalysts, to the design of P-ligands with potential biomedical applications and, in the process, have uncovered reasons why, seemingly improbable, platinum(0)-catalysed hydrophosphination reactions proceed at all.\n\nProfessor Liam Ball, University of Bristol  \n*Organobismuth reagents for synthesis and catalysis*  \nDr Michelle Ma, Kings College London  \n*Delivery of radioactive 99mTc and 188Re to cancers using versatile diphosphine chelators*  \nProfessor Derek Woollins, University of St. Andrews (Emeritus)  \n*The Isolobal Analogy in p block chemistry ..a history lesson*  \nThe symposium is free to attend, but pleaseregister by completing the online form.  \n##### Further information  \n12 November 2025, 1 PM to 5 PM.  \nLT2, School of Chemistry",

The research team therefore aimed to find a more efficient method of making tetrasubstituted alkenes, including Tamoxifen, which allows them to be easily manipulated and adapted into different forms.  \nThe new method offers a highly versatile solution to building complex tetrasubstituted alkenes from simple building blocks.  \n“The findings change our understanding of the fundamental chemistry of this group of organic molecules,\" said Professor Varinder Aggarwal, the study's lead author. \"It presents exciting implications because the science allows us to make alternatives of the drug Tamoxifen, with potentially greater potency and less unwanted side effects.”  \nFellow School of Chemistry researchers Dr Adam Noble and Dr Liang Wei were among the co-authors of the paper, which was a collaboration with colleagues at Colorado State University.

After I completed my undergraduate degree at another university, the Master of Science by Research in Chemistry offered at Bristol seemed ideal for me. Firstly, there are no timed exams, and secondly, I could choose the area of Chemistry that I wanted to work in. Upon arriving here, I found there to be even more flexibility and was able to tailor my project to suit my interests.  \nMy supervisor has been very open to my ideas, and we work together to develop experiments that I find interesting for my research project. Studying a one-year research course can be intense as you must learn how to work in a laboratory quickly and how to design experiments that are realistic. My supervisor has been very helpful in steering my more ambitious ideas to make them feasible. If I suggest an idea that I am interested to explore, but not 100% sure of, my supervisor has always found a way to guide me.  \nThe extensive postgraduate research facilities at Bristol are also great resources to help bring my ideas for experiments to life. In addition, because Bristol is a large university, there are lots of societies and social events to become involved with. For example, I joined the run club and have met lots of other researchers who are doing other interesting projects – this has been a great way to network and generate ideas for my own research. The main thing I have learnt in Bristol is how to spot opportunities and find information, both for my research and for my life!\"  \n---  \n****Dania Binti Md Khairuldin****  \n!A picture of Dania Binti Md Khairuldin, an MSc by research student  \n\"I chose the University of Bristol due to its ranking and reputation.

My time in Bristol gave me new perspectives, opportunities for international networking, meeting new people and I learned to appreciate diversity. The skills, knowledge and experiences I gained have been central to my successes in research, in areas including environmental science, food security, drug delivery, biotechnology and bio-sensors. I have published more than ten books and book chapters, and more than 150 peer-reviewed scientific articles in international journals. I was fortunate to gain 3 years’ experience as an undergraduate laboratory demonstrator in Bristol ChemlabS, and I have embodied the Bristol approach in my home university. Joining the outreach program at Bristol taught me how to make science and chemistry more engaging, fun and fascinating to the general public.

    "document": "Tracers are compounds that are used to \"track\" air movements in either the urban environment or over a wider range and entail short or medium-term release of selected tracers over a range of defined topography. Typical urban measurements are made over distances up to 1km whereas longer range experiments have involved distances of over 100km. The typical longer range experiments carried out by the group involve distances up to 18km. Tracers inherently are compounds that are not normally present in the atmosphere, or present at very low levels. The principle of tracer work is to release the tracer at a level that will ensure a concentration of tracer at the receptor (sampling site) of at least 10 times the background concentration. The tracers used by the group are a range of compounds called perfluorocarbons which have been found to have normal atmospheric concentrations in the order of parts per quadrillion (1 in 10-14 ) or lower. Other tracers used include sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and carbon dioxide all of which are unreactive, non-toxic and non-flammable chemicals, completely safe to release within an urban environment.. The experiments help to determine the dispersion effects of pollution on (for example) street canyons and other urban situations. Such dispersion studies, in conduction with appropriate meteorological understanding increases the ability for prediction of dispersion patterns within complex terrain.\n\n!Release apparatus for perfluorocarbons during URGENT programThe various distances involved in the work require different release techniques in order to cope adequately with the quantities of tracer that are needed to be released. The equipment shown in the picture on the right was designed for the URGENT campaign - a medium range release of tracer up to 18km - which required direct release of a liquid tracer - in this case a perfluorocarbon such as perfluoromethylcyclohexane - where a release of several grams of tracer over a time span of a few minutes is required in order to achieve a suitable concentration for analysis in the final sample.  \nOver shorter distances - such as street canyon simulations or the road intersection for DAPPLE - an alternative approach is adopted and a tracer/air mixture is released from a pressurised can.  \nIn either case the release rate is monitored - by weight in the case of liquid release and by pressure decay for the air/tracer mix - to determine how much tracer has actually been released. The MkII liquid release kit is described later.",

    "document": "The tracer dispersion programs rely on efficient and fast sampling of air samples which can be subsequently stored for later analysis in the Bristol laboratories. Two main air samplers are employed in our studies, both types are designed to be fully automated for unattended operation.\n\n!Macrotrap air samplerMacrotrap samplers evolved from our experience using adsorbent technology to selectively remove target analytes from air sampled outlined in the ADS technology section. Air samples of 3 Litres are directed to one of 15 adsorbent-filled macrorotraps mounted on a central sampling valve. After sampling, the trap is isolated until analysis. The method entails heating of the macrotraps under nitrogen flow directed into the ADS for refocusing prior to GC-MS separation and detection. Macrotrap samplers are used where the sampling time interval is large (20 min per air sample or greater) at a variety of sampling flow rates (up to 500scc/min) and is particularly useful when determining the decay curve once the tracer release has been terminated. They are designed to be self contained, are powered either by mains electricity or a small lead acid battery and therefore can be used in a variety of locations  \nA macrotrap air sampler, these selectively trap tracer compounds onto adsorbant tubes, the tubes can then be returned to the ACRG for analysis.  \n!Schematic of macrotrap sampler  \nSchematic diagram of the macrotrap air sampler.\n\n!Bag ladder samplers Bag samplers are simple devices designed to sequentially fill Tedlar bags in an automated manner. Internal pumps flush the air sample stream through a ladder block plumbing arrangement and flow is diverted using micro-solenoid valves for each Tedlar bag. The ladder samplers can accommodate 10 bags each and during tracer release campaigns we deploy up to 10 ladder boxes. Filled Tedlar bags can be swapped for fresh ones by an operator in experiments requiring more than 10 air samples at a ladder location.\n\n!Release apparatus for perfluorocarbons during LaBTex programMuch of the original release and sampling equipment, although portable, was relatively heavy and therefore not easily set up by one or two people.  \nThe liquid release kit has been substantially redesigned and is now much more portable - the dispersion unit and temperature control unit can now be carried in a single \"tea crate\" type storage box.  \nSampling has also been changed by the introduction of portable sampling units (SKC universal pumps). Although these are for single bags, modification of the sampling protocol allows multiple bag samples to be taken by a single operator over varying lengths of time. Samples can be as short as 3 mins with a 30 second interval between samples.",

The air parcels are advected every three hours using a 4th order Runge-Kutta scheme via a Lagrangian approach. It is an offline model with the transport and radiation driven by archived meteorological data from the UK Meteorological Office Unified Model which operates at a grid resolution of 1.25° longitudes by 0.83° latitude and twelve unevenly spaced vertical levels, with an upper boundary up to 100 hPa. The chemical processes that occur within the parcel, together with emission, deposition (both dry and wet) and removal processes are generally uncoupled from transport processes to enable local determination of the chemistry timestep The chemical mechanism in this model is the common representative intermediates mechanism version 2, reduction 5 (CRI v2-R5), which consists of 229 chemical species competing in 627 reactions. STOCHEM-CRI outputs onto grid cells with a resolution of 5° longitude by 5° latitude and has 9 vertical levels, which span from the surface up to an altitude of 16km. It has been used extensively to simulate a range of tropospheric gases and aerosols & evaluated in model inter-comparison studies.  \n**Regional modelling – WRF-Chem**  \nWRF-Chem is a regional 3-dimensional meteorological model with online chemistry. It has a 15km horizontal resolution and 41 vertical levels, with enhanced resolution within the boundary layer. Meteorology is driven using ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis data with a 6 hourly time resolution, and surface data extracted on a N256 gaussian grid, while volume data was extracted at a lower resolution on a N128 gaussian grid. WRF-Chem simulates the emission, transport, mixing and chemical processing of trace gases on the same time step as the meteorology. This makes the model ideal for investigating the impacts of weather on atmospheric composition (and vice versa) on a regional scale. The gas phase chemistry in the model is treated using the CRI-v2R5 mechanism and the aerosol scheme used is MOSAIC with 8 size bins (from 0.03-10 μm).",

The ACRG are collaborating with the Chulabhorn Research Institute in Thailand to investigate the effects of some air pollutants on pregnant women and their children. This study will provide new information on the method by which pollutants may cause cancer in children through exposure to their pregnant mothers.  \nPrevious collaborations with CRI funded by the Newton Fund and have shown high levels of pollutants within aerosols in Bangkok, with some carcinogenic compounds related to traffic emission concentrated in the smaller inhalable size fractions. The ACRG will continue to investigate pollutants concentrated within aerosol and build pollutant maps of Bangkok and the surrounding area using WRF-Chem modelling software, validated by field measurements.  \nPregnant volunteers from two locations in Thailand, one of high pollution levels and one of low pollutant levels, are being recruited to take part in the study. The researchers will measure the amount of pollution that these women are exposed to, looking at a range of different particles and chemicals present in the air where they live. The women will donate biological samples from themselves, and samples of the placenta and umbilical cord blood once their babies are born. From these samples, the team in Thailand will look for biomarkers of exposure, which will indicate the risk of developing cancer in the future.  \nUsing pollutant modelling, and measurements in both Bristol and Bangkok, we will be able to estimate the childhood cancer risk associated with air pollution in Thailand and the UK. This research is funded by Children with Cancer UK.",

    "document": "![]()Investigating HALocarbon impacts on the global Environment (InHALE; <>) is a research project funded by theNatural Environmental Research Councilunder theHighlight Topics, a route for funding strategic research.  \nSince the mid-20th century, halocarbons – a group of chemicals used widely as refrigerants, foam blowing agents, solvents, and propellants – have had a major influence on the stratospheric ozone layer and climate. Observations of the abundance of these compounds in the atmosphere reveal complex trends driven by changes in their production and use, and by the landmark environmental treaty, theMontreal Protocol. Since the signing of theMontreal Protocolin 1987, growth rates of the regulated ozone depleting substances (ODSs), the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), have declined substantially. However, concentrations of their replacements, the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are potent greenhouse gases (GHGs), are increasing rapidly. Therefore, in 2019, theKigali Amendmentto the MP came into force, aiming to limit future growth of HFCs and preserve the Montreal Protocol’s impact on climate.  \nRecent measurement and model studies, many of which were led by our team, have revealed that there remain substantial scientific challenges that must be addressed to ensure the continued success of the Montreal Protocol:  \n1. Identifying unreported production\n2. Finding missing emissions\n3. Quantifying growth and impacts of unregulated ODSs\n4. Detecting emerging halocarbons\n5. Evaluating breakdown products with potentially harmful environmental impacts\n6. Assessing climate impact  \nFor more details go to the InHALE website:<>",
